<h3>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h3>

<h3>QUINCY ADAMS SAWYER'S</h3>

<p class="narrow250">only title was plain "Mr." His ancestors
were tradesmen, merchants, lawyers, politicians,
and Presidents. He, too, was proud
of his honored ancestry, and I have endeavored
in this book to have him live up to
an ideal personification of gentlemanly qualities
for which the New England standard
should be fully as high as that of Old
England; in fact, I see no reason why the
heroes of American novels, barring the single
matter of hereditary titles, should not compare
favorably as regards gentlemanly attributes
with their English cousins across the
seas.<br /></p>

<h3>THE REHEARSAL.<br /></h3>


<p>It was a little after seven o'clock on the evening of December
31, 186&mdash;. Inside, the little red schoolhouse
was ablaze with light. Sounds of voices and laughter came
from within and forms could be seen flitting back and forth
through the uncurtained windows. Outside, a heavy fall
of snow lay upon hill and vale, trees and house-tops, while
the rays of a full-orbed moon shone down upon the glistening,
white expanse.</p>

<p>At a point upon the main road a short distance beyond
the square, where the grocery store was situated, stood a
young man. This young man was Ezekiel Pettengill, one
of the well-to-do young farmers of the village. His coat
collar was turned up and his cap pulled down over his ears,
for the air was piercing cold and a biting wind was blowing.
Now and then he would walk briskly back and forth for a
few minutes, clapping his hands, which were encased in
gray woollen mittens, in order to restore some warmth to
those almost frozen members. As he walked back and
forth, he said several times, half aloud to himself, "I don't
b'lieve she's comin' anyway. I s'pose she's goin' to stay<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
ter hum and spend the evenin' with him." Finally he resumed
his old position near the corner and assumed his
previous expectant attitude.</p>

<p>As he looked down the road, a man came out of Mrs.
Hawkins's boarding house, crossed the road and walked
swiftly towards him.</p>

<p>As the new-comer neared him, he called out, "Hello, Pettengill!
is that you? Confounded cold, ain't it? Who wuz
yer waitin' for? Been up to the schoolhouse yet?"</p>

<p>To these inquiries 'Zekiel responded: "No!" and added,
"I saw yer comin' out of the house and thought I'd walk up
with yer."</p>

<p>"Wall! they can't do nuthin' till I git thar," said Mr.
Obadiah Strout, the singing-master, "so we shall both be on
time. By the way," he continued, "I was up to Boston
to-day to git some things I wanted for the concert to-morrer
night, and the minister asked me to buy some new music
books for the church choir, and I'm goin' up there fust to
take 'em;" and 'Zekiel's attention was attracted to a package
that Mr. Strout held under his arm. "Say, Pettengill!"
continued Mr. Strout, "when yet git up ter the schoolhouse,
tell them I'll be along in a few minutes;" and he started off,
apparently forgetful of 'Zekiel's declaration that he had
intended to walk up with him.</p>

<p>It is evident that 'Zekiel's statement was untruthful, for
his words have betrayed the fact that it was not the Professor
of whom he had been thinking.</p>

<p>'Zekiel did not move from his position until he had seen
Strout turn into the yard that led to the front door of the
minister's house. Then he said to himself again, "I don't
believe she's comin', arter all."</p>

<p>As he spoke the words a deep, heavy sigh came from his
great, honest heart, heard only by the leaflless trees through
which the winter wind moaned as if in sympathy.</p>

<p>What was going on in the little red schoolhouse? The<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
occasion was the last rehearsal of the Eastborough Singing
Society, which had been studying vocal music assiduously
for the last three months under the direction of Professor
Obadiah Strout, and was to give its annual conceit the following
evening at the Town Hall at Eastborough.</p>

<p>A modest sum had been raised by subscription. A big
barge had been hired in Cottonton, and after the rehearsal
there was to be a sleigh ride to Eastborough Centre and return.
It was evident from the clamor and confusion that
the minds of those present were more intent upon the ride
than the rehearsal, and when one girl remarked that the
Professor was late, another quickly replied that, "if he
didn't come at all 'twould be early enough."</p>

<p>There were about two score of young persons present,
very nearly equally divided between the two sexes. Benjamin
Bates was there and Robert Wood, Cobb's twins,
Emmanuel Howe, and Samuel Hill. Among the girls were
Lindy Putnam, the best dressed and richest girl in town,
Mandy Skinner, Tilly James, who had more beaus than any
other girl in the village; the Green sisters Samanthy and
Betsy, and Miss Seraphina Cotton, the village schoolteacher.</p>

<p>Evidently all the members of the society had not arrived,
for constant inquiries were being made about Huldy Mason
and 'Zekiel Pettengill. When Betsy Green asked Mandy
Skinner if Hiram Maxwell wa'n't comin', the latter replied
that he'd probably come up when Miss Huldy and the new
boarder did.</p>

<p>News had reached the assemblage that Arthur Scates,
the best tenor singer in the society, was sick. Lindy Putnam
was to sing a duet with him at the concert, and so she
asked if anybody had been to see him.</p>

<p>"I was up there this arternoon," said Ben Bates, "and he
seemed powerful bad in the throat. Grandmother Scates
tied an old stocking 'round his throat and gin him a bowl of<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
catnip tea and he kinder thought he'd be all right to-morrer.
I told him you'd have a conniption fit if he didn't
show up, but Grandmother Scates shook her head kind o'
doubtful and said, 'The Lord's will be done. What can't
be cured must be endured;' and I guess that's about the
way it will be."</p>

<p>The outer door opened and 'Zekiel Pettengill entered.
The creaking of the opening door attracted the attention of
all. When the girls saw who it was, they ran and gathered
about him, a dozen voices crying out, "Where is Huldy?
We all thought she'd come with you."</p>

<p>'Zekiel shook his head.</p>

<p>"You don't know?" asked Tilly James, incredulously.
'Zekiel shook his head again. "Of course you do," said
Tilly contemptuously.</p>

<p>She turned away, followed by a number of the girls.
"He knows well enough," she observed in an undertone,
"but he won't tell. He's gone on Huldy, and when a
feller's gone on a girl he's pretty sure to keep the run of
her."</p>

<p>In the meantime Lindy Putnam had been using her most
persuasive powers of coaxing on 'Zekiel and with same success,
for 'Zekiel told quite a long story, but with very little
information in it. He told the crowd of girls gathered
about him that he'd be twenty-eight on the third of January,
and that ever since he was a little boy, which was, of course,
before any of those present were born, he'd always followed
the rule of not saying anything unless he knew what he
was talking about.</p>

<p>"Now," said 'Zekiel, feeling that it was better to talk on
than to stand sheep-facedly before this crowd of eager, expectant
faces, "I might tell yer that Huldy was ter hum
and wasn't comin' up to-night, but yer see, p'r'aps she's on
the road now and may pop in here any minute! Course
you all know Deacon Mason's got a boarder, a young feller<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
from the city. P'r'aps he'll come up with Huldy. But I
heerd tell his health wa'n't very good and mebbe he went to
bed right after supper."</p>

<p>"What's he down here for anyway?" asked Tilly James.</p>

<p>"Now you've got me," replied 'Zekiel. "I s'pose he had
some purpose in view, but you see I ain't positive even of
that. As I said before, I heerd he's come down here for his
health. It's too late for rakin' hay, and as hard work's the
best country doctor, p'r'aps he'll go to choppin' wood; but
there's one point I feel kinder positive on."</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it?" cried the girls, as they looked
into his face inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Wall, I think," drawled 'Zekiel, "that when he gits what
he's come for, he'll be mighty apt to pull up stakes and go
back to Boston."</p>

<p>Again the outer door creaked upon its hinges, and again
every face was turned to see who the new-comer might be.</p>

<p>"Here she is," cried a dozen voices; and the owners
thereof rushed forward to greet and embrace Miss Huldy
Mason, the Deacon's daughter and the most popular girl in
the village.</p>

<p>'Zekiel turned and saw that she was alone. Evidently
the city fellow had not come with her.</p>

<p>Huldy was somewhat astonished at the warmth of her
greeting, and was at a loss to understand the reason for it,
until Lindy Putnam said:</p>

<p>"Didn't he come with you?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Huldy, with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't fool us," cried Tilly James. "'Zeke Pettengill
told us all about that city feller that's boarding
down to your house. We were just talking it over together,
and he surmised that it might be the same one that
you met down to your aunt's house, when you went to
Boston last summer."</p>

<p>"As Mr. Pettengill seems to know so much about my<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
gentlemen friends, if you want any more information, no
doubt he can supply it," said Huldy coldly.</p>

<p>"'Zeke kinder thought," said Bob Wood, "that he
might be tired, and probably went to bed right after
supper."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't," said Huldy, now thoroughly excited,
"he came with me, and he's outside now talking with
Hiram about the barge."</p>

<p>"Why don't he come in?" asked Bob Wood. "P'r'aps
he's bashful."</p>

<p>"If he didn't have no more common sense than you've
got," retorted Huldy, "he'd have to go to bed as soon as
he had eaten his supper."</p>

<p>The laugh that followed this remark so incensed Wood
that he answered coarsely, "I never saw one of those city
chaps who knew B from a bull's foot."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he'll teach you the difference some day," remarked
Huldy, sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not," said Wood with a sneer; "'less he
can put two b's in able."</p>

<p>Further altercation was stopped by the sudden entrance
of Mr. Strout, who quickly ascended the platform and
called the society to order. It must be acknowledged that
the Professor had a good knowledge of music and thoroughly
understood the very difficult art of directing a
mixed chorus of uncultivated voices. With him enthusiasm
was more important than a strict adherence to quavers
and semiquavers, and what was lost in fine touches was
more than made up in volume of tone.</p>

<p>Again, the Professor paid strict attention to business at
rehearsals, and the progress of the society in musical knowledge
had been very marked. So it is not to be wondered
at that the various numbers allotted to the chorus on the
next evening's programme were gone through quickly and
to the evident satisfaction of the leader.</p><p><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></p>

<p>The last number to be taken up was an original composition,
written and composed by the singing-master himself,
and during its rehearsal his enthusiasm reached its
highest pitch. At the conclusion of the chorus, which had
been rendered with remarkable spirit, the Professor darted
from one-end of the platform to the other, crying out,
"Bravo! Fust rate! Do it again! That'll fetch 'em!"</p>

<p>After several repetitions of the chorus, each one given
with increasing spirit and volume, the Professor threw down
his baton and said: "That'll do. You're excused until to-morrow
night, seven o'clock sharp at Eastborough Town
Hall. I guess the barge has just drove up and we'd better
be gittin' ready for our sleigh ride."</p>

<p>Miss Tilly James, who had acted as accompanist on the
tin-panny old piano, was putting up her music. The Professor,
with his face wreathed in smiles, walked up to her
and said, "I tell you what, Miss James, that last composition
of mine is bang up. One of these days, when the 'Star
Spangled Banner,' 'Hail Columbia,' and 'Marching through
Georgia' are laid upon the top shelf and all covered with
dust, one hundred million American freemen will be singing
Strout's great national anthem, 'Hark, and hear the
Eagle Scream.' What do you think of that prophecy?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Miss James, turning her pretty face
towards him, her black eyes snapping with fun, "that if
conceit was consumption, there'd be another little
green grave in the cemetery with O. Strout on the headstone."</p>

<p>The Professor never could take a joke. In his eye, jokes
were always insults to be resented accordingly. Turning
upon the young lady savagely, he retorted:</p>

<p>"If sass was butter, your folks wouldn't have to keep any
cows."</p>

<p>Then he walked quickly across the room to where 'Zekiel<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
Pettengill stood aloof from the rest, wrapped in some
apparently not very pleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>At this juncture Hiram Maxwell dashed into the schoolroom,
and judging from appearances his thoughts were of
the pleasantest possible description.</p>

<p>"Say, fellers and girls," he cried, "I've got some news for
yer, and when you hear it you'll think the day of judgment
has come, and you're goin' to git your reward."</p>

<p>An astonished "Oh!" came up from the assemblage.</p>

<p>"Out with it," said Bob Wood, in his coarse, rough voice.</p>

<p>"Well, fust," said Hiram, his face glowing with animation,
"you know we got up a subscription to pay for the
barge and made me treasurer, cuz I worked in a deacon's
family. Wall, when I asked Bill Stalker to-night how much
the bill would be, just to see if I'd got enough, he told me
that a Mr. Sawyer, who said he 'boarded down to Deacon
Mason's, had paid the hull bill and given him a dollar beside
for hisself." Cheers and the clapping of hands showed
that the city fellow's liberality was appreciated by a majority,
at least, of the singing society. "When we git on the
barge I'll pay yer back yer money, and the ride won't cost
any one on us a durn cent. That ain't all. Mr. Sawyer jest
told me hisself that when he was over to Eastborough
Centre yesterday he ordered a hot supper for the whole
caboodle, and it'll be ready for us when we git over to the
Eagle Hotel. So come along and git your seats in the
barge." A wild rush was made for the door, but Hiram
backed against it and screamed at the top of his voice:
"No two girls must sit close together. Fust a girl, then a
feller, next a girl, then a feller, next a girl, then a feller,
that's the rule."</p>

<p>He opened the door and dashed out, followed by all the
members of the society excepting the Professor and 'Zekiel,
who were left alone in the room.</p>

<p>"See that flock of sheep," said the Professor to 'Zekiel,<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
with a strong touch of sarcasm in his tone. "That's what
makes me so cussed mad. Brains and glorious achievement
count for nothin' in this community. If a city swell
comes along with a pocketful of money and just cries,
'Baa,' over the fence they all go after him."</p>

<p>"Hasn't it always been so?" asked 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Strout. "In the old days, kings
and queens and princes used to search for modest merit,
and when found they rewarded it. Nowadays modest merit
has to holler and yell and screech to make folks look at it."</p>

<p>Hiram again appeared in the room, beckoning to the two
occupants.</p>

<p>"Say, ain't you two comin' along?" he cried. "We've
saved good places for yer."</p>

<p>"Where's Mr. Sawyer?" asked 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's goin' along with the crowd," said Hiram; "he's
got a seat in between Miss Putnam and Miss Mason, and
looks as snug as a bug in a rug. There's a place for you,
Mr. Pettengill, between Miss Mason and Mandy, and I
comes in between Mandy and Mrs. Hawkins. Mandy
wanted her mother to go cuz she works so confounded hard
and gits out of doors so seldom, and there's a seat 'tween
Mrs. Hawkins and Tilly James for the Professor, and Sam
Hill's t'other side of Tilly and nex' to S'frina Cotton."</p>

<p>"I guess I can't go," said 'Zekiel. "The house is all alone,
and I'm kind of 'fraid thet thet last hoss I bought may get
into trouble again as he did last night. So I guess I'd
better go home and look arter things." Leaning over he
whispered in Hiram's ear, "I reckon you'd better take the
seat between Huldy and Mandy, you don't want ter
separate a mother from her daughter, you know."</p>

<p>"All right," said Hiram, with a knowing wink, "I'm
satisfied to obleege."</p>

<p>Hiram then turned to the Professor: "Ain't yer goin',
Mr. Strout?"</p><p><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></p>

<p>"When this sleigh ride was projected," said the Professor
with dignity, "I s'posed it was to be for the members of the
singin' class and not for boardin' mistresses and city
loafers."</p>

<p>"I guess it don't make much difference who goes," replied
Hiram, "as long as we git a free ride and a free supper
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Present my compliments to Mr. Sawyer," said the Professor,
"and tell him I've had my supper, and as I don't
belong to a fire company, I don't care for crackers and
cheese and coffee so late in the evenin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh!" cried Hiram, "it's goin' to be a turkey supper,
with fried chicken and salery and cranberry juice, and
each feller's to have a bottle of cider and each girl a bottle
of ginger ale."</p>

<p>A horn was heard outside, it being the signal for the
starting of the barge. Without stopping to say good-by,
Hiram rushed out of the room, secured his seat in the barge,
and with loud cheers the merry party started off on their
journey.</p>

<p>The Professor extinguished the lights and accompanied
by 'Zekiel left the building. He locked the door and hung
the key in its accustomed place, for no one at Mason's Corner
ever imagined that a thief could be so bad as to steal
anything from a schoolhouse. And it was once argued in
town meeting that if a tramp got into it and thus escaped
freezing, that was better than to have the town pay for
burying him.</p>

<p>Both men walked along silently until they reached Mrs.
Hawkins' boarding house; here the Professor stopped and
bade 'Zekiel good night. After doing so he added:</p>

<p>"Pettengill, you and me must jine agin the common
enemy. This town ain't big enough to hold us and this
destroyer of our happiness, and we must find some way of
smokin' him out."</p><p><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></p>

<p>The slumbers of both 'Zekiel and the Professor were
broken when the jolly party returned home after midnight.
'Zekiel recalled Hiram's description of the arrangement of
seats, and another deep sigh escaped him; but this time
there were no leafless trees and winter wind to supply an
echo.</p>

<p>The Professor's half-awakened mind travelled in very
different channels. He imagined himself engaged in several
verbal disputes with a number of fisticuff encounters in
which he invariably proved to be too much for the city
fellow. Just before he sank again into a deep sleep he
imagined that the entire population of Mason's Corner
escorted a certain young man forcibly to the railroad station
at Eastborough Centre and put him in charge of the
expressman, to be delivered in Boston. And that young
man, in the Professor's dream, had a tag tied to the lapel of
his coat upon which was written, "Quincy Adams Sawyer."</p><p><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></p>

<h3>MASON'S CORNER FOLKS.<br /></h3>

<p>In 186&mdash;the town of Eastborough was located in the
southeastern part of Massachusetts, in the county of
Normouth. It was a large town, being fully five miles
wide from east to west and from five to seven miles long,
the northern and southern boundaries being very irregular.</p>

<p>The town contained three villages; the western one being
known as West Eastborough, the middle one as Eastborough
Centre, and the easterly one as Mason's Corner.
West Eastborough was exclusively a farming section, having
no store or post office. As the extreme western boundary
was only a mile and a half from Eastborough Centre,
the farmers of the western section of the town were well
accommodated at the Centre. The middle section contained
the railroad station, at which five trains a day, each
way, to and from Boston, made regular stops. The Centre
contained the Town Hall, two churches, a hotel, and express
office, a bank, newspaper office, and several general
stores. Not very far from the hotel, on a side road, was
the Almshouse, or Poorhouse, as it was always called by
the citizens of Eastborough.</p>

<p>Between the Centre and Mason's Corner was a long
interval of three miles. The land bordering the lower and
most direct route was, to a great extent, hilly and rocky,
or full of sand and clay pits. The upper and longest road
ran through a more fertile section. The village of Mason's
Corner contained the best arable land in the town, and the
village had increased in population and wealth much faster
than the other sections of the town. To the east of the village<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
of Mason's Corner lay the town of Montrose, and beyond
that town was situated the thriving city of Cottonton,
devoted largely, as its name indicated, to the textile manufacturing
industries.</p>

<p>The best known and most popular resident of Mason's
Corner was Deacon Abraham Mason. He was a retired
farmer on the shady side of fifty. He had married young
and worked very hard, his labors being rewarded with pecuniary
success. When a little over fifty, he gave up active
farm work and devoted his time to buying and selling real
estate, and to church and town affairs, in both of which he
was greatly interested. His house stood about halfway
down a somewhat steep hill, the road over which, at the
top, made a sharp turn. It was this turn which had received
the appellation of Mason's Corner and from which the
village eventually had taken its name.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sophia Mason, the Deacon's wife, was a little less
than fifty years of age. She was a comely, bright-faced,
bright-eyed, and energetic woman, who had been both a
loving wife and a valued helpmeet to her husband. Their
only living child was a daughter named Huldah Ann, about
nineteen years of age, and considered by many to be the
prettiest and smartest girl in Mason's Corner. The only
other resident in Deacon Mason's house was Hiram Maxwell,
a young man about thirty years of age. He had been
a farm hand, but had enlisted in 1861, and served through
the war. On his return home he was hired by Deacon
Mason to do such chores as required a man's strength, for
the Deacon's business took him away from home a great
deal. Hiram was not exactly what would be called a pronounced
stutterer or stammerer; but when he was excited
or had a matter of more than ordinary importance to communicate,
a sort of lingual paralysis seemed to overtake
him and interfered materially with the vocal expression of
his thoughts and ideas. Type would be inadequate to express<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
the facial contortions and what might be termed the
chromatic scales of vocal expression in which he often indulged,
and they are, therefore, left for full comprehension
to those of inventive and vivid imaginative powers. This
fact should not be lost sight of in following the fortunes of
this brave soldier, honest lover, good husband, and successful
business man.</p>

<p>The Pettengill homestead was situated on the other side
of the road, southwest from Deacon Mason's house.
Ezekiel's grandfather had left three sons, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, the latter being Ezekiel's father. Abraham had
died when he was a young man, and Jacob had been dead
about five years. Uncle Ike was in his seventy-sixth year,
and was Ezekiel's only living near relative, with the exception
of his sister Alice, who had left home soon after her
father's death and was now employed as bookkeeper in a
large dry goods store in Boston.</p>

<p>Ezekiel was about twenty-eight years of age, being seven
years older than his sister. He was a hardy, strong-willed,
self-reliant young fellow. He loved farming and had resolved
to make a better living out of it than his father had
ever done. A strong incentive to win success proceeded
from the fact that he had long been in love with "Huldy
Ann," the Deacon's daughter, and he had every reason to
believe that his affection was returned, although no formal
engagement existed between them, and marriage had never
been spoken of by them or the young lady's parents.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike Pettengill had been a successful business man
in Boston, but at the age of sixty had wearied of city life,
and decided to spend the rest of his days in the country.
Despite the objections of his wife and two grown up daughters,
he sold out his business, conveyed two-thirds of his
property to his wife and children, and invested the remaining
third in an annuity, which gave him sufficient income
for a comfortable support. He did not live at the Pettengill<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
house, but in a little two-roomed cottage or cabin that he
had had built for him on the lower road, about halfway
between Mason's Corner and Eastborough Centre. A
short distance beyond his little house, a crossroad, not very
often used, connected the upper and lower roads. Uncle
Ike had a fair-sized library, read magazines and weekly
papers, but never looked at a daily newspaper. His only
companions were about two hundred hens and chickens and
a big St. Bernard dog which he had named "Swiss," after
his native land.</p>

<p>The other residents of the Pettengill homestead were
two young men named Jim and Bill Cobb, who aided
Ezekiel in his farm work, and Mandy Skinner, the "help,"
who was in reality the housekeeper of the establishment.
Jim and Bill Cobb were orphans, Jim being about twenty-one
and Bill three years older. When young they resembled
each other very closely, for this reason they had
been nicknamed "Cobb's Twins," and the name had clung
to them, even after they had reached manhood.</p>

<p>Mandy Skinner was about twenty-three, and was the only
child of Malachi and Martha Skinner. Her father was dead,
but her mother had married again and was now Mrs. Jonas
Hawkins, the proprietor of Mrs. Hawkins's boarding house,
which was situated in the square opposite Hill's grocery,
and about a quarter of a mile from the top of Mason's Hill.
Mandy had a double burden upon her shoulders. One was
the care of such a large house and family, and the other
was the constant necessity of repelling the lover-like hints
and suggestions of Hiram Maxwell, who was always ready
and willing to overlook his work at Deacon Mason's so
that he could run down and see if Mandy wanted him to do
anything for her.</p>

<p>Hill's grocery was owned and carried on by Benoni Hill
and his son Samuel. Their residence was on the easterly
edge of the town, being next to the one occupied by old<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
Ben James, who was a widower with one daughter, Miss
Matilda James.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile east of Hill's grocery was the
village church, presided over by the Rev. Caleb Howe. He
had one son, Emmanuel, who had graduated at Harvard
and had intended to fit for the ministry, but his health had
failed him and he had temporarily abandoned his studies.
He was a great admirer of Miss Lindy Putnam, because, as
he said, she was so pretty and accomplished. But after
long debate one evening at the grocery store, it had been
decided without a dissenting vote that "the minister's son
was a lazy 'good-for-nothing', and that he wanted the
money more than he did the gal." The village schoolhouse
stood a short distance eastward from the church. The
teacher, Miss Seraphina Cotton, a maiden lady of uncertain
age, who boasted that the city of Cottonton was named after
her grandfather, boarded at the Rev. Mr. Howe's, and was
ardently attached to the minister's wife, who was an invalid
and rarely seen outside of her home.</p>

<p>On the upper road, about half a mile to the west of Deacon
Mason's, lived Mr. and Mrs. Silas Putnam. They
owned the largest house and best farm at Mason's Corner.
They were reputed to be quite wealthy and it was known
for a sure fact that their only daughter, Lindy, was worth
one hundred thousand dollars in her own right, it having
been left to her by her only brother, J. Jones Putnam, who
had died in Boston about five years before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins had a large house, but it was always full
of boarders, all of the masculine gender. Mrs. Hawkins
had declared on several occasions that she'd "sooner have
the itch than a girl boarder." She was a hard-working
woman and had but one assistant, a young girl named
Betsy Green, one of whose sisters was "working-out" up at
Mrs. Putnam's. Mrs. Hawkins's husband, his wife declared,<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
was "no account nohow," and for the present her estimate
of him must be accepted without question.</p>

<p>Among Mrs. Hawkins's twelve boarders were Robert
Wood and Benjamin Bates, two young men who were natives
of Montrose. Bates was a brick and stone mason,
and Wood was a carpenter, and they had been quite busily
employed during the two years they had lived at Mason's
Corner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins owned a buggy and carryall and a couple
of fairly good horses. They were cared for by Abner Stiles.
He was often called upon to carry passengers over to the
railway station at the Centre, and was the mail carrier between
the Centre and Mason's Corner, for the latter village
had a post office, which was located in Hill's grocery, Mr.
Benoni Hill being the postmaster.</p>

<p>Since his return from the war Mr. Obadiah Strout had
been Mrs. Hawkins's star boarder. He sat at the head of
the table and acted as moderator during the wordy discussions
which accompanied every meal. Abner Stiles believed
implicitly in the manifest superiority of Obadiah
Strout over the other residents of Mason's Corner. He
was his firm ally and henchman, serving him as a dog does
his master, not for pay, but because he loves the service.</p>

<p>Mr. Strout was often called the "Professor" because he
was the singing-master of the village and gave lessons in
instrumental and vocal music. The love of music was another
bond of union between Strout and Stiles, for the latter
was a skilful, if not educated, performer on the violin.</p>

<p>The Professor was about forty years of age, stout in person,
with smooth shaven face and florid complexion. In
Eastborough town matters he was a general factotum. He
had been an undertaker's assistant and had worked for the
superintendent of the Poorhouse. In due season and in
turn he had been appointed to and had filled the positions of
fence viewer, road inspector, hog reeve, pound keeper, and<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
the year previous he had been chosen tax collector. Abner
Stiles said that there "wasn't a better man in town for
selectman and he knew he'd get there one of these days."</p>

<p>To those residents of Mason's Corner whose names have
been given, whose homes have been described and some
whose personal peculiarities have been portrayed, must be
added a late arrival. The new-comer whose advent in town
during Christmas week had caused so much discussion at
the rehearsal in the old red schoolhouse, and whose liberality
in providing a hot supper with all the fixings for the
sleighing party from Mason's Corner, when it arrived at
the Eagle Hotel at Eastborough Centre, had won, at a
bound, the hearts of the majority of the younger residents
of Mason's Corner. The village gossips wondered who he
was, what he was, what he came for, and how long he
intended to stay. If these questions had been asked of him
personally, he might have returned answers to the first
three questions, but it would have been beyond his power
to have answered the fourth inquiry at that time. But the
sayings and doings of certain individuals, and a chain of
circumstances not of his own creation and beyond his personal
control, conspired to keep him there for a period of
nearly four months. During that time certain things were
said and done, certain people were met and certain events
took place which changed the entire current of this young
man's future life, which shows plainly that we are all creatures
of circumstance and that a man's success or failure
in life may often depend as much or even more upon his
environment than upon himself.</p><p><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE CONCERT IN THE TOWN HALL.<br /></h3>

<p>It was the evening of New Year's day, 186&mdash;. The leading
people, in fact nearly all the people of the three
villages forming the town of Eastborough, were assembled
in the Town Hall at Eastborough Centre. The evening was
pleasant and this fact had contributed to draw together the
largest audience ever assembled in that hall. Not only was
every seat taken, but the aisles were also crowded, while
many of the younger citizens had been lifted up to eligible
positions in the wide window seats of the dozen great windows
on three sides of the large hall.</p>

<p>The large attendance was also due in part to the fact
that a new and original musical composition by Mr. Strout,
the singing-master, would be sung for the first time in public.
Again, it had been whispered up at Hill's grocery at
Mason's Corner that the young city fellow who was boarding
at Deacon Mason's was going to be present, and this
rumor led to a greatly increased attendance from that
village.</p>

<p>The audience was a typical one of such communities at
that period; horny-handed farmers with long shaggy beards
and unkempt hair, dressed in ill-fitting black suits; matronly
looking farmers' wives in their Sunday best; rosy-cheeked
daughters full of fun and vivacity and chattering like magpies;
tall, lank, awkward, bashful sons, and red-haired,
black-haired, and tow-headed urchins of both sexes, the
latter awaiting the events of the evening with the wild anticipations<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
that are usually called forth only by the advent
of a circus.</p>

<p>The members of the chorus were seated on the large platform,
the girls being on the right and the fellows on the
left. A loud hum of conversation arose from the audience
and chorus, a constant turning over and rattling of programmes
gave a cheerful and animated appearance to the
scene. The centre door at the rear of the platform was
opened and all eyes were turned in that direction, the chorus
twisting their necks or turning half 'round in their seats.</p>

<p>Professor Strout entered and was greeted with a loud
burst of applause. He wore a dress suit that he had hired
in Boston, and there was a large white rose in the lapel of
his coat. He was accompanied by Miss Tilly James, the
pianist, who wore a handsome wine-colored silk dress that
had been made for the occasion by the best dressmaker in
Cottonton. As she took her place at the piano and ran her
fingers over the keys, she, too, came in for a liberal round
of applause. Professor Strout bowed to the audience, then
turning his back upon them, he stood with baton uplifted
facing the chorus and waiting the advent of the town committee.
Every eye in the audience was fixed upon the programme.
It contained the information that the first number
was an opening chorus entitled, "Welcome to the Town
Committee," written and composed by Professor Obadiah
Strout and sung for the first time with great success at the
last annual concert.</p>

<p>The door at the rear of the platform was opened again
and Deacon Abraham Mason, the Rev. Caleb Howe, and
Mr. Benoni Hill, the members of the town committee on
singing school, entered. Deacon Mason was accompanied
by Quincy Adams Sawyer, and all eyes were fastened on
the couple as they took their seats at the right of the platform,
the Rev. Mr. Howe and Mr. Hill being seated on the
left.</p><p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></p>

<p>Quincy Adams Sawyer in appearance and dress was a
marked contrast to the stout, hardy, and rugged young
farmers of Eastborough. He had dark hair, dark eyes, and
a small black mustache curled at the ends. His face was
pallid, but there was a look of determination in the firmly
set jaw, resolute mouth, and sharp eye. He wore a dark
suit with Prince Albert coat. Upon one arm hung an overcoat
of light-colored cloth. He wore light-brown kid
gloves and in one hand carried a light-colored Kossuth hat.</p>

<p>As soon as the committee and their guest had taken their
seats, Professor Strout tapped upon his music stand with
his baton and the members of the Eastborough Singing
Society arose to their feet with that total disregard of uniformity
and unanimity of motion that always characterizes
a body of undrilled performers. Each girl was obliged to
look at her own dress and that of her neighbor to see if
they were all right, while each fellow felt it absolutely necessary
to shuffle his feet, pull down his cuffs, pull up his collar,
and arrange his necktie. Despite the confusion and
individual preparations the chorus took the opening note
promptly and sang the "Welcome to the Town Committee"
with a spirit and precision which well merited the applause
it received. The words were not printed on the programme,
but they conveyed the idea that the members of the singing
class were very much obliged to the town committee
for hiring a singing-master and paying his salary. Also
that the members of the chorus had studied hard to learn to
sing and would do their best that evening as a return for
the favors-bestowed upon them by the town.</p>

<p>Professor Strout then advanced to the edge of the platform
and called the attention of the audience to the second
number upon the programme which read, "Address by
Abraham Mason, Esq." Prof. Strout added that by special
request Deacon Mason's remarks would relate to the subject
of "Education." The Deacon drew a large red bandanna
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>handkerchief from his pocket, wiped the perspiration
from his forehead, blew his nose vigorously, and then
advanced to the centre of the platform near the music stand.</p>

<p>"I dote on eddikation," he began; "it makes the taxes
high; I've lived in this town man and boy more'n fifty year
and I never saw them anythin' but high." A general
laugh greeted this remark. "But when I'm in town meetin'
I allus votes an aye to make our schools as good as
those found in neighborin' towns, and none of them are
any too good. For my political actions I'm proud to give
my grounds, for I never cast a vote that I was ashamed to
give my reasons for." A burst of applause followed this
declaration.</p>

<p>"Years back when I was young, we had no modern
notions. We had to be satisfied with the three R's, Readin',
'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic, and larnin' was dealt out in rather
meagre potions, 'bout three months in the winter after the
wood was cut, sawed and split, and piled up in the wood-shed.
We allus had to work in the summer, make hay and
fill the barn in, and not till winter come could get a speck
of larnin,' and then it took most of our time to pile wood
into the stove and settle our personal accounts with the
teacher." An audible titter ran through the audience at this
sally. "And yet when I was young, though this community
was rather behind in letters, no people in the land could
say they were our betters. But now the world is changed,
we live without such grubbin', learn Latin, French, and
Greek, how to walk Spanish, talk Dutch, draw picters,
keep books, fizziology, and lots of other 'ologies and much
piano drubbin'. Now what brought this about? I think
I have a notion; you know the immergrants from about
every country under the sun have piled across the ocean.
They've done the diggin' and other rough work and we've
thruv on their labor. I have some ready cash. Mr. Strout
comes 'round and gets some of't every year, and likewise<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>my neighbor has some put aside for a rainy day." Many
of the audience who probably had nothing laid aside
glanced at the well-to-do farmers who had the reputation of
being well fixed as regards this world's goods. "Perhaps
I'm doin' wrong, but I would like my darter to know as
much as those that's likely to come arter. But if the world
keeps on its progress so bewild'rin' and they put some more
'ologies into the schools together with cabinet organs and
fife and drum, I'm afraid it will cost my darter more than
it did me to eddikate her childrin."</p>

<p>A storm of applause filled the hall when the Deacon concluded
his remarks. As he resumed his chair, Quincy
handed him a tumbler of water that he had poured from a
pitcher that stood upon a table near the piano. This act
of courtesy was seen and appreciated by the audience and a
loud clapping of hands followed. At the commencement
of the Deacon's speech, the Professor had left the platform,
for it gave him an opportunity for an intended change of
costume, for which time could be found at no other place
on the programme. It was a marvellous rig that he wore
when he reappeared. A pair of white duck pantaloons,
stiffly starched, were strapped under a pair of substantial,
well-greased, cowhide boots. The waistcoat was of bright-red
cloth with brass buttons. The long-tailed blue broad-cloth
coat was also supplied with big brass buttons. He
wore a high linen dickey and a necktie made of a small silk
American flag. On his head he had a cream-colored, woolly
plug hat and carried in his hand a baton resembling a small
barber's pole, having alternate stripes of red, white, and
blue with gilded ends.</p>

</div>

<p>The appearance of this apparition of Uncle Sam was
received with cries, cheers, and loud clapping of hands. The
Professor bowed repeatedly in response to this ovation, and
it was a long time before he could make himself heard by
the audience. At last he said in a loud voice:</p><p><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></p>

<p>"The audience will find the words of number three
printed on the last page of the programme, and young and
old are respectfully invited to jine in the chorus."</p>

<p>A fluttering of programmes followed and this is what the
audience found on the last page, "Hark! and Hear the Eagle
Scream, a new and original American national air written,
composed, and sung for the first time in public by Professor
Obadiah Strout, author of last season's great success, 'Welcome
to the Town Committee,'"</p>

<span class="i0">CHORUS:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Professor Strout sang the solo part of the song himself.
The singing society and many of the audience joined in the
chorus. Like many teachers of vocal music, the Professor
had very little voice himself, but he knew how to make
the best possible use of what he did possess. But the patriotic
sentiment of the words, the eccentric make-up of the
singer his comical contortions and odd grimaces, and what
was really a bright, tuneful melody won a marked success
for both song and singer. Encore followed encore. Like
many more cultured audiences in large cities the one assembled
in Eastborough Town Hall seemed to think that
there was no limit to a free concert and that they were
entitled to all they could get. But the Professor himself
fixed the limit. When the song had been sung through
three times he ran up the centre aisle of the platform and
facing the audience, he directed the chorus, holding the
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>variegated baton in one hand and swinging his woolly plug
hat around his head with the other. At the close, amid
screams, cheers, and clapping of hands, he turned upon his
heel, dashed through the door and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>The next number upon the programme was a piano solo
by Miss Tilly James. Nothing could have pleased her audience
any better than the well-known strains of the ever
popular "Maiden's Prayer." In response to an encore
which Quincy originated, and dexterously led, Miss James
played the overture to Rossini's "William Tell" without
notes. A fact which was perceived by the few, but unnoticed
by the many.</p>

<p>At the close of these instrumental selections, the Professor
reappeared in evening costume and again assumed
the directorship of the concert. Robert Wood had a ponderous
bass voice, which if not highly cultivated was highly
effective, and he sang "Simon the Cellarer" to great acceptation.
Next followed a number of selections sung
without accompaniment by a male quartette composed of
Cobb's twins, who were both tenors, Benjamin Bates, and
Robert Wood. This feature was loudly applauded and one
old farmer remarked to his neighbor, who was evidently
deaf, in a loud voice that was heard all over the hall, "That's
the kind of music that fetches me," which declaration was a
signal for another encore.</p>

<p>The singing society then sang a barcarolle, the words of
the first line being, "Of the sea, our yacht is the pride." It
went over the heads of most of the audience, but was greatly
appreciated fey the limited few who were acquainted with
the difficulties of accidentals, syncopations, and inverted
musical phrases.</p>

<p>According to the programme the next feature was to be
a duet entitled "Over the Bridge," composed by Jewell and
sung by Arthur Scates and Miss Lindy Putnam. The Professor
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>stepped forward and waved his hand to quiet the
somewhat noisy assemblage.</p>

<p>"The next number will have to be omitted," he said,
"because Mr. Scates is home sick abed. The doctor says
he's got a bad case of quinsy," with a marked emphasis on
the last word, which, however, failed to make a point. "In
response to requests, one verse of 'Hark! and Hear the
Eagle Scream' will be sung to take the place of the piece
that's left out."</p>

<p>While the Professor was addressing the audience, Quincy
had whispered something in Deacon Mason's ear which
caused the latter to smile and nod his head approvingly.
Quincy arose and reached the Professor's side just as the
latter finished speaking and turned towards the chorus.
Quincy said something in a low tone to the Professor which
caused Mr. Strout to shake his head in the negative in a
most pronounced manner. Quincy spoke again and looked
towards Miss Putnam, who was seated in the front row,
and whose face wore a somewhat disappointed look.</p>

<p>Again the Professor shook his head by way of negation
and the words, "It can't be did," were distinctly audible to
the majority of both singing society and audience, at the
same time a look of contempt spread over the singing-master's
face. Quincy perceived it and was nettled by it.
He was not daunted, however, nor to be shaken from his
purpose, so he said in a loud voice, which was heard in all
parts of the hall: "I know the song, and will sing it if
Miss Putnam and the audience are willing."</p>

<p>With a smile upon her face, Miss Putnam nodded her
acquiescence. All the townspeople had heard of Quincy's
liberality in providing a hot supper for the sleighing party
the night before, and cries of "Go ahead! Give him a
chance! We want to hear him!" and "Don't disappoint
Miss Putnam," were heard from all parts of the hall. The
Professor was obliged to give in. He sat down with a
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>disgusted look upon his face, and from that moment war
to the knife was declared between these champions of city
and country civilization.</p>

<p>Mr. Sawyer went to the piano, opened Miss James's copy
of the music and placed it upon the music rack before her,
saying a few words to her which caused her to smile.
Quincy then approached Lindy, opened her music at the
proper place and passed it to her. Next he took her hand
and led her to the front of the platform. These little acts
of courtesy and politeness, performed in an easy, graceful,
and self-possessed manner, were seen by all and won a
round of applause.</p>

<p>The duet was beautifully sung. Quincy had a fine well-trained
tenor voice, while Miss Putnam's mezzo-soprano
was full and melodious and her rendition fully as artistic
as that of her companion. One, two, three, four, five, six
encores followed each other in quick succession, in spite of
Professor Strout's endeavors to quell the applause and
take up the next number. The ovation given earlier in the
evening to Professor Strout was weak in comparison with
that vouchsafed to Quincy and Lindy when they took their
seats. In vain did the Professor strive to make himself
heard. Audience and chorus seemed to be of one mind.
The Professor, his face as red as a beet, turned to Ezekiel
Pettengill and said:</p>

<p>"That was a mighty impudent piece of business, don't
you think so?"</p>

<p>"They're both mighty fine singers," Ezekiel responded
in a rather unsympathetic tone.</p>

<p>Quincy realized that something must be done to satisfy
the demands of the now thoroughly excited audience.
Going to Miss James, he asked her a question in a low
voice, in reply to which she nodded affirmatively. He next
sought Miss Putnam and evidently asked her the same
question, receiving a similar answer. Then he led her forward,
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>and she sang the opening part of "Listen to the
Mocking Bird." After they had sung the chorus it was
repeated on the piano and Quincy electrified the audience
by whistling it, introducing all the trills, staccatos, and
roulades that he had heard so many times come from under
Billy Morris's big mustache at the little Opera House on
Washington Street, opposite Milk, run by the Morris
Brothers, Johnny Pell, and Mr. Trowbridge, and when he
finished there flashed through his mind a pleasant memory
of Dr. Ordway and his Aeolians. An encore was responded
to, but the tumult still continued. Turning to Ezekiel,
Strout said:</p>

<p>"Ain't it a cussed shame to spoil a first-class concert this
way?"</p>

<p>"He's a mighty fine whistler," replied Ezekiel in the
same tone that he had used before.</p>

<p>Finally to quiet their exuberance Quincy was obliged to
say a few words, which were evidently what the audience
was waiting for.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "the hour is getting
late and there is another number on the programme. Miss
Putnam is tired and I shall have to wet my whistle before
I can use it again. I thank you for your kind indulgence
and applause."</p>

<p>This little speech pleased the audience. It was down to
their level, with "no sign of stuckupativeness about it," as
one country girl remarked to her chum. Quincy bowed,
the audience laughed, and quiet was restored.</p>

<p>The Professor had fidgeted, fumed, and fussed during
Quincy's occupancy of the platform. He now arose with
feelings impossible to express and took up his baton to lead
the closing chorus. He brought it down with such a
whack upon the music stand that it careened, tottered, and
fell to the platform with a crash. Tilly James leaned over
and whispered to Huldy Mason: "The Professor seems to
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>have a bad attack of Quincy, too." And the two girls
smothered their laughs in their handkerchiefs. If the singing
society had not been so well acquainted with the closing
chorus the Professor certainly would have thrown them
out by his many mistakes in beating time. The piece was a
"sleighride" song. The Professor forgot to give the signal
for the ringing of the sleigh bells, but the members of the
singing society did not, and their introduction, which was
unexpected by the audience, to use a theatrical term,
"brought down the house." The number was well rendered,
despite the manifest defects in leadership. The concert
came to a close.</p>

<p>Deacon Mason and his wife, accompanied by their
daughter, Huldy, and Rev. Mr. Howe, occupied a double
sleigh, as did Hiram, Mandy, and Cobb's twins. Another
double-seated conveyance contained Mr. and Mrs. Benoni
Hill, their son, Samuel, and Miss Tilly James. Quincy also
had accommodations for four in his sleigh, but its only
occupants were Miss Putnam and himself. Abner Stiles
sat on the front seat of another double-seated sleigh, while
the Professor and Ezekiel were on the back one; the remainder
of the Mason's Corner folks occupied the big
barge which had been used for the sleigh ride the night
before.</p>

<p>The barge led the procession to Mason's Corner,
followed by the vehicles previously mentioned and scores
of others containing residents of Mason's Corner, whose
names and faces are alike unknown. By a strange fatality,
the sleigh containing the Professor and Ezekiel was the
last in the line. Ezekiel was inwardly elated that Mr. Sawyer
had gone home with Lindy instead of with Deacon
Mason's party. Strout's bosom held no feelings of elation.
He did not seem to care whether the concert was considered
a success or not. He had but one thought in his mind,<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>and that was the "daring impudence of that city feller."
Turning to Ezekiel, he said:</p>

<p>"I'll get even with that city chap the next time I meet
him. As I said last night, Pettengill, this town ain't big
enough to 'hold both on us and one on us has got to git."</p>

<p>As he said this, he leaned back in the sleigh and puffed
his cigar savagely while Ezekiel was wondering if Huldy
was thinking half as much about him as he was about her.</p><p><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></p>

<h3>ANCESTRY VERSUS PATRIOTISM.<br /></h3>


<p>Four days had passed since the concert in the Town
Hall at Eastborough. The events of that evening had
been freely discussed in barn and workshop, at table and at
the various stores in Eastborough and surrounding towns,
for quite a number had been present who were not residents
of the town. All interest in it had not, however, passed
away as subsequent occurrences proved.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the fifth of January. Benoni Hill,
who ran the only grocery store at Mason's Corner, was
behind his counter and with the aid of his only son, Samuel,
was attending to the wants of several customers.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, Miss Tilly James entered, and
young Samuel Hill forgot to ask the customer on whom he
had been waiting the usual question, "Anything else,
ma'am?" so anxious was he to speak to and wait upon the
pretty Miss James, whose bright eyes, dark curly hair, and
witty remarks had attracted to her side more suitors than
had fallen to the lot of any other young girl in the village.
As yet she had evinced no especial liking for any particular
one of the young men who flocked about her, and this
fact had only served to increase their admiration for her
and to spur them on to renewed efforts to win her favor.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss James," said Samuel, "I can't get
it out of my ears yet." As he said this, he leaned over the
counter, and being a brave young man, looked straight into
Miss James's smiling face.</p><p><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></p>

<p>"If all home remedies have failed," said Tilly, "why don't
you go to Boston and have a doctor examine them?"</p>

<p>"What a joker you are!" remarked Samuel; "I believe
you will crack a joke on the minister the day you are married."</p>

<p>"It may be my last chance," rejoined Tilly. "Mother
says the inside of a boiled onion put into the ear is good for
some troubles; give me a pound of tea, Oolong and green
mixed, same as we always have."</p>

<p>As Samuel passed the neatly done up package to Miss
James, he leaned across the counter again and said in a
low voice, "You know what is in my ears, Miss James.
How beautifully you played for Mr. Sawyer when he
whistled 'Listen to the Mocking Bird.' I don't think I shall
ever forget it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about the playing, Mr. Hill. I came
near losing my place several times, because I wanted so
much to hear him whistle."</p>

<p>During this conversation Tilly and Samuel had been so
preoccupied that they had not noticed the entrance of a
new-comer and his approach towards them. Only one
other customer, a little girl, was left in the store, and Mr.
Hill, Sr., had gone down cellar to draw her a quart of
molasses.</p>

<p>As Tilly uttered the words, "I wanted so much to hear
him whistle," she heard behind her in clear, melodious,
flute-like notes, the opening measures of "Listen to the
Mocking Bird." Turning quickly, she saw Mr. Sawyer
standing beside her.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Mr. Sawyer? I am delighted to
see you again," she said in that hearty, whole-souled way
that was so captivating to her country admirers.</p>

<p>"The delight is mutual," replied Quincy, raising his hat
and bowing.</p>

<p>Samuel Hill was evidently somewhat disturbed by the
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>great friendliness of the greetings that he had just witnessed.
This fact did not escape Tilly's quick eye, and turning
to Mr. Sawyer she said:</p>

<p>"Have you been introduced to my friend, Mr. Samuel
Hill?"</p>

<p>"I have not had that pleasure," replied Quincy. "This
is my first visit to the store."</p>

<p>"Then allow me," continued Tilly, "to present you to
Mr. Samuel Hull and to Mr. Benoni Hill, his father, both
valued friends of mine," and she added, as a roguish smile
came into her face, "as they keep the only grocery store in
the village, you will be obliged to buy what they have and
pay them what they ask, unless you prefer a three-mile
tramp to Eastborough Centre."</p>

<p>"I hope you're enjoyin' your stay at Mason's Corner,"
said Mr. Benoni Hall, "though I don't s'pose you city folks
find much to please yer in a country town, 'specially in the
winter."</p>

<p>"So far I have found two things that have pleased me
very much," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"The milk and eggs, I suppose," remarked Tilly.</p>

<p>"No," said Quincy, "I refer to Miss Lindy Putnam's
fine singing and the beautiful playing of a young lady who
is called Miss James."</p>

<p>"I have heard," said Tilly, "that you city gentlemen are
great flatterers. That is not the reason why I am obliged
to leave you so suddenly, but the fact is the tea caddy ran
low this morning and grandma's nerves will remain unstrung
until she gets a cup of strong tea."</p>

<p>With a graceful bow and a parting wave of the hand to
the three gentlemen, the bright and popular young lady
left the store.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hill," said Quincy, addressing the elder gentleman,
"I've smoked all the cigars that I brought from Boston,
but Deacon Mason told me perhaps you had some
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>that would suit me. I like a good-sized, strong cigar and
one that burns freely."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Hill, "Professor Strout is the most partikler
customer I have in cigars; he says he always smokes
a pipe in the house, 'cause it don't hang round the room
so long as cigar smoke does, but he likes a good cigar to
smoke on the street or when he goes ridin'. I just had
a new box come down for him last night. Perhaps some
of them will satisfy yer till I can git jest the kind yer want."</p>

<p>Mr. Hill took his claw-hammer and opening the box
passed it to Quincy, who took one of the cigars and lighted
it. As he did so he glanced at the brand and the names of
the makers, and remarked, "This is a good cigar, I've
smoked this brand before. What do you ask for them?"</p>

<p>"I git ten cents straight, but as Mr. Strout always smokes
up the whole box before he gits through, though he don't
usually buy more than five at a time, I let him have 'em
for nine cents apiece. There ain't much made on them,
but yer see I have to obleege my customers."</p>

<p>"You don't ask enough for them," said Quincy, throwing
down a twenty-dollar bill. "They sell for fifteen cents,
two for a quarter, in Boston."</p>

<p>"How many will you have?" asked Mr. Hill, thinking
that Boston must be a paradise for shopkeepers, when seven
cents' profit could be made on a cigar that cost only eight
cents.</p>

<p>"I'll take the whole box," said Quincy. "Call it ten
dollars, that's cheap enough. No matter about the discount."
As he said this he took half a dozen cigars from
the box and placed them in a silver-mounted, silk-embroidered
cigar case. "Please do them up for me, Mr.
Hill, and the next time Hiram Maxwell comes in he will
take them down to Deacon Mason's for me."</p>

<p>After much rummaging through till and pocketbook,
Mr. Hill and his son found ten dollars in change, which
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>was passed to Quincy. He stuffed the large wad of small
bills and fractional currency into his overcoat pocket and
sitting down on a pile of soap boxes drummed on the lower
one with his boot heels and puffed his cigar with evident
pleasure.</p>

<p>While Quincy was thus pleasantly engaged, Professor
Strout entered the store and walked briskly up to the counter.
He did not see, or if he did, he did not notice, Quincy
who kept his place upon the pile of soap boxes. Strout
was followed by Abner Stiles, Robert Wood, and several
other idlers, who had been standing on the store platform
when the Professor arrived.</p>

<p>"Did those cigars come down, Hill?" asked Strout in his
usual pompous way.</p>

<p>"Yes!" replied Mr. Hill, "but I guess you'll have to wait
till I gut another box down."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Strout sharply. "Wa'n't it understood
between us that them cigars was to be kept for me?"</p>

<p>"That's so," acknowledged Mr. Hill, "but you see, when
I told that gentleman on the soap box over yonder that you
smoked them, he bought the whole box, paid me a cent
more apiece than you do. A dollar's worth saving nowadays.
He says they sell for fifteen cents, two for a quarter,
up in Boston."</p>

<p>"If he's so well posted on Boston prices," growled Strout,
"why didn't he pay them instead of cheatin' you out of two
dollars and a half? I consider it a very shabby trick, Mr.
Hill. I shall buy my cigars at Eastborough Centre in the
future. Perhaps you'll lose more than that dollar in the
long run."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the gentleman will let you have some of them,"
expostulated Mr. Hill, "till I can get another box."</p>

<p>"All I can say is," said Strout in snappish tones, "if the
man who bought them knew that you got them for me, he
was no gentleman to take the whole box. What do yer
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>say, Stiles?" he asked, turning to Abner, who had kept his
eyes fixed on the placid Quincy since entering the store,
though listening intently to what the Professor said.</p>

<p>"Well, I kinder reckon I agree to what you say, Professor,"
drawled Abner, "unless the other side has got some
sort of an explanation to make. 'Tain't quite fair to judge
a man without a hearin'."</p>

<p>"Allow me to offer you one of your favorite brand, Professor
Strout," said Quincy, jumping down from the soap
boxes and extending his cigar case.</p>

<p>"No! thank you!" said Strout, "I always buy a box at a
time, the same as you do. Judging from the smell of the
one you are smoking, I guess they made a mistake on that
box and sent second quality. Give me a five-cent plug, Mr.
Hill, if some gentleman hasn't bought out your whole
stock. I fancy my pipe will have to do me till I get a
chance to go over to Eastborough Centre."</p>

<p>During this conversation Hiram Maxwell had come in to
do an errand for Mrs. Mason, and several more platform
idlers, having heard the Professor's loud words, also
entered.</p>

<p>Strout was angry. When in that condition he usually
lost his head, which he did on this occasion. Turning to
Quincy he said with a voice full of passion:</p>

<p>"What's yer name, anyway? You've got so many of
them I don't know which comes fust and which last. Is it
Quincy or Adams or Sawyer? How in thunder did you
get 'em all, anyway? I s'pose they tucked 'em on to you
when you was a baby and you was too weak to kick at
being so abused."</p>

<p>At this sally a loud laugh arose from the crowd gathered
in the store, and Abner Stiles, who was the Professor's
henchman and man-of-all-work, cried out, "Fust blood for
the Professor."</p>

<p>Quincy faced the Professor with a pale face and spoke in
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>clear, ringing tones, still holding his lighted cigar between
the fingers of his right hand. When he spoke all listened
intently.</p>

<p>"Your memory has served you well, Mr. Strout. You
have got my names correct and in the proper order, Quincy
Adams Sawyer. I do not consider that any child could be
abused by being obliged to wear such honored names as
those given me by my parents. My mother was a Quincy,
and that name is indissolubly connected with the history
and glory of our common country. My father's mother was
an Adams, a family that has given two Presidents to the
United States. If your knowledge of history is as great as
your memory for names you should be aware of these facts,
but your ignorance of them will not affect the opinion of
those knowing to them. My father, Nathaniel Adams Sawyer,
has a world-wide reputation as a great constitutional
lawyer, and I am proud to bear his name, combined with
those of my illustrious ancestors. It is needless for me to
add that I, too, am connected with the legal profession."</p>

<p>Here Hiram Maxwell called out, "First round for Mr.
Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you dough-head," cried Strout, his face purple
with rage. Turning to Quincy he said in a choked
voice, "My name is Obadiah Strout, no frills or folderols
about it either. That was my father's name too, and he
lived and died an honest man, in spite of it. He raised
potatoes and one son, that was me. When the nation called
for volunteers I went to war to save the money bags of
such as you that stayed at home. It was such fellers as
you that made money out of mouldy biscuits and rotten
beef, shoddy clothin', and paper-soled boots. It was such
fellers as your father that lent their money to the government
and got big interest for it. They kept the war going
as long as they could. What cared they for the blood of
the poor soldier, as long as they could keep the profits and
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>interest coming in? It wasn't the Quincys and the Adamses
and the other fellers with big names that stayed at home
and hollered who saved the country, but the rank and file
that did the fightin', and I was one of them."</p>

<p>As he said this the irascible Professor shook his fist in
Quincy's face, to which a red flush mounted, dyeing cheek
and brow.</p>

<p>"That's the Lord's truth," said Abner Stiles. Then he
called out in a loud voice, "Second round for the Professor.
Now for the finish."</p>

<p>But the finish did not come then. The settlement between
these two lingual disputants did not come for many
days. The reason for a sudden cessation of the wordy conflict
was a shrill, feminine voice, which cried out from the
store platform:</p>

<p>"Hiram Maxwell, where are you? Mother's most out of
patience waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" cried Hiram, breaking through the crowd
and rushing to the counter to make the long-deferred purchase.
"I'm coming in a minute."</p>

<p>"I think I had better see you home," remarked Huldy
Mason, entering the store.</p>

<p>As she advanced the crowd separated and moved backward,
leaving her a dear path.</p>

<p>"Why, how do you do, Mr. Sawyer?" said she in a pleasant
voice and with a sweet smile, as she reached Quincy.
"Won't you help me take Hiram home?"</p>

<p>"I should be happy to be of service to you," replied
Quincy.</p>

<p>The professor turned his back toward Miss Mason and
began talking in an animated manner to Abner Stiles, Bob
Wood, and a few other ardent sympathizers who gathered
about him.</p>

<p>The rest of the crowd were evidently more interested in
watching the pretty Miss Mason and the genteel Mr. Sawyer.<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>
When Hiram left the store with his purchases under
one arm and Quincy's box of cigars under the other, he was
closely followed by Quincy and Huldy, who were talking
and laughing together. The crowd of loungers streamed
out on the platform again to watch their departure. As
Quincy and Huldy turned from the square into the road
that led to the Deacon's house they met Ezekiel Pettengill.
Huldy nodded gayly and Quincy raised his hat, but
Ezekiel was not acquainted with city customs and did not
return the salutation. A few moments later the Professor
and Abner Stiles were relating to him the exciting occurrences
of the last half hour.</p><p><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></p>

<h3>MR. SAWYER MEETS UNCLE IKE.<br /></h3>


<p>Quincy Adams Sawyer had not come down to
Mason's Corner with any idea of becoming a hermit.
His father was a great lawyer and a very wealthy man.
He had made Quincy a large allowance during his college
days, and had doubled it when his only son entered his law
office to complete his studies.</p>

<p>Quincy had worked hard in two ways; first, to read law,
so as to realize the great anticipations that his father had
concerning him; second, he worked still harder between
eight in the evening and one, two, and even four in the
morning, to get rid of the too large allowance that his father
made him.</p>

<p>Like all great men, his father was unsuspicious and easily
hoodwinked about family matters; so when Quincy grew
listless and on certain occasions fell asleep at his desk his
renowned and indulgent father decided it was due to overwork
and sent him down to Eastborough for a month's rest
and change of scene.</p>

<p>His father had known Isaac Pettengill, and in fact had
conducted many successful suits for him; besides this he
had drawn up the papers when Uncle Ike divided his fortune.
Quincy's father had written to Uncle Ike, asking
him to find his son a boarding place, and Uncle Ike had
selected Deacon Mason's as the best place for him.</p>

<p>Quincy's father had told him to be sure and get acquainted
with Mr. Isaac Pettengill, saying he was a man of
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>fine education, and added, "I sometimes feel, Quincy, as
though I would like to go into the country and take care of
a chicken farm myself for a while."</p>

<p>His mother came of the best New England stock, and
although she had been named Sarah and her husband's
name was Nathaniel, we have seen that the son had been
endowed with the rather high-sounding name of Quincy
Adams, which his schoolmates had shortened to Quince,
and his college friends had still further abbreviated to
Quinn. Quincy had two sisters and they had been equally
honored with high-sounding appellations, the elder being
called Florence Estelle and the younger Maude Gertrude,
but to pa, ma, brother, and friends they were known as
Flossie and Gertie.</p>

<p>The next day after the affair at Hill's grocery, Quincy
put several of the best cigars in town in his pocket and
started towards Eastborough Centre for a walk, intending
to call upon Uncle Ike Pettengill.</p>

<p>The young man knew that late hours and their usual accompaniments
were what had undermined his health, so
he determined to make his vacation of good service to him
and recover his accustomed health and strength, and when
he returned home cut his old acquaintances and settle down
earnestly and honestly to the battle of life.</p>

<p>He had teen a favorite in city society; he was well educated,
well read, had travelled considerably and was uniformly
polite and affable to all classes, from young children
to old men and women; he was very careful about his
dress, and always had that well-groomed appearance, which
in the city elicits commendation, but which leads the average
countryman to say "dude" to himself and near friends
when talking about him.</p>

<p>Quincy was no dude; he had been prominent in all college
athletic games; he had been a member of the 'varsity eight
in one of its contests with Yale, and had won a game for<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
Harvard with Yale at base ball by making a home run in the
tenth inning on a tied score. He was a good musician and
fine singer. In addition he was a graceful dancer, and had
taken lessons in boxing, until his feather-weight teacher
suggested that he had better find a heavy-weight instructor
to practise on.</p>

<p>Quincy was in his twenty-third year. He had been in love
a dozen times, but, as he expressed it, had been saved from
matrimony by getting acquainted with a prettier girl just as
he was on the point of popping the question.</p>

<p>But we left him walking along on his way to Eastborough
Centre. Deacon Mason had told him Uncle Ike's house
was away from the road, some hundred feet back, and that
he could not mistake it, as he could see the chicken coop
from the road. He finally reached it after traversing about
a mile and a half, it being another mile and a half to Eastborough
Centre.</p>

<p>He found the path that led to the house. As he neared
the steps a huge dog arose from a reclining posture and
faced him, not in an ugly mood, but with an expression that
seemed to-say, "An introduction will be necessary before
you come any farther." The dog seemed to understand
that it was his duty to bring about the necessary introduction,
so he gave a series of loud barks. The door was
quickly opened and Uncle Ike stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Do I address Mr. Isaac Pettengill?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike replied, "That's what they write on my letters."</p>

<p>Quincy continued, "My name is Quincy Adams Sawyer.
I am the only son of the Hon. Nathaniel Sawyer of Boston,
and I bear a letter of introduction from him to you."</p>

<p>Quincy took the letter from his pocket and held it in his
hand. The dog made a quick movement forward and before
Quincy could divine his object, he took the letter in
his mouth and took it to Uncle Ike, and, returning, faced
Quincy again.</p><p><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></p>

<p>Uncle Ike read the letter slowly and carefully; then he
turned to Quincy and said, "If you will talk about birds,
fish, dogs, and chickens, you are welcome, and I shall be
glad to see you now or any time. If you talk about lawsuits
or religion I shall be sorry that you came. I am sick
of lawyers and ministers. If you insist upon talking on such
subjects I'll tell Swiss, and the next time you come he
won't even bark to let me know you're here."</p>

<p>Quincy took in the situation, and smiling said, "I am
tired of lawyers and lawsuits myself; that is the reason I
came down here for a change. The subjects you mention
will satisfy me, if you will allow me to put in a few words
about rowing, running, boxing, and football."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike replied, "The physically perfect man I admire,
the intellectually perfect man is usually a big bore; I prefer
the company of my chickens." Turning to Swiss he said
with a marked change in his voice, "This is a friend of mine,
Swiss." Turning to Quincy he said, "He will admit you
until I give him directions to the contrary."</p>

<p>The dog walked quietly to one side and Quincy advanced
with outstretched hand toward Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike did not extend his. He said, "I never shake
hands, young man. It is a hollow social custom. With
Damon and Pythias it meant something. One was ready
to die for the other, and that hand-clasp meant friendship
until death. How many hand shakings mean that nowadays?
Besides," with a queer smile, "I have just been
cutting up a broiler that I intend to cook for my dinner.
Come in, you are welcome on the conditions I have mentioned."</p>

<p>Quincy obeyed and stepped into the kitchen of Sleepy
Hollow. He owned to himself in after years that that was
the most important step he had taken in life&mdash;the turning-point
in his career.</p><p><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></p>

<h3>SOME NEW IDEAS.<br /></h3>


<p>"Did you ever kill a chicken?" asked Uncle Ike, as
Quincy entered the room and took a seat in the willow
rocker Uncle Ike pointed out to him.</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy, "but out in Chicago I saw live
hogs killed, bristles taken off, cut up, assorted according to
kind and quality, and hung up to cool off, in three minutes."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike responded vehemently, "Yes, I know, and it is
a shame to the American people that they allow such
things."</p>

<p>"That may be true," said Quincy, "but even at that speed
they cannot kill and pack as fast as it is wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Uncle Ike, "in the old days man feared God,
and he treated man and beast better for that reason. In
these days man serves Mammon and he will do anything to
win his favor."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is true that men were better in the old
days?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," answered Uncle Ike, "I didn't say so. I said that
in the old days man was afraid to do these things; now if he
has money he is afraid of neither God, man, nor the devil.
To speak frankly, that is why I am so independent myself.
I am sure of enough to support me as long as I live; I owe
no man anything, and I allow no man to owe me anything."</p>

<p>Quincy, changing the subject, inquired, "What is your
method of killing chickens?"</p><p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></p>

<p>Uncle Ike said, "Let me tell you why I devised a new
plan. When I was about eight years old I went with my
mother to visit an uncle in a neighboring town. I was
born in Eastborough myself, in the old Pettengill house.
But this happened some twenty miles from here. My uncle
was chopping wood, and boy like, I went out to watch him.
An old rooster kept running around the block, flapping its
wings, making considerable noise. Uncle shooed him off
three or four times. Finally uncle made a grab at him,
caught him by the legs, whacked him down on the block
and with his axe cut off his head close to his body, and then
threw it out on the grass right in front of me. Was that
rooster dead? I thought not. It got up on its legs, ran
right towards where I was sitting, and before I could get
away I was covered with the blood that came from its neck.
I don't know how far the rooster ran, but I know I never
stopped until I was safe in my mother's arms. The balance
of the time I stayed there you couldn't get me within forty
yards of my uncle, for every time I met him I could see
myself running around without my head."</p>

<p>"That made a lasting impression on you," remarked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Uncle Ike, "it has lasted me sixty-eight years,
one month, and thirteen days," pointing to a calendar that
hung on the wall.</p>

<p>As Quincy looked in the direction indicated he saw
something hanging beside it that attracted his attention.</p>

<p>It was a sheet of white paper with a heavy black border.
Within the border were written these words, "Sacred to
the memory of Isaac Pettengill, who was killed at the battle
of Gettysburg, July 4th, 1863, aged twenty-nine years. He
died for his namesake and his native land."</p>

<p>Quincy said interrogatively, "Did you lose a son in the
war?"</p><p><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></p>

<p>"No," was the reply. "I never had a son. That was
my substitute."</p>

<p>"Strange that your substitute should have the same name
as yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would have been if he had, but he didn't. His
right name was Lemuel Butters. But I didn't propose to
put my money into such a name as that."</p>

<p>"Were you drafted?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," said Uncle Ike. "I might as well tell you the
whole story, for you seem bound to have it. I came down
here in 1850, when I was about sixty. Of course I knew
what was going on, but I didn't take much interest in the
war, till a lot of soldiers went by one day. They stopped
here; we had a talk, and they told me a number of things
that I hadn't seen in the papers. I haven't read the daily
papers for thirteen years, but I take some weeklies and the
magazines and buy some books. Well, the next day I
went over to Eastborough Centre and asked the selectmen
how much it would cost to send a man to the war.
They said substitutes were bringing $150 just then, but
that I was over age and couldn't be drafted, and there was
no need of my sending anybody. I remarked that in my
opinion a man's patriotism ought not to die out as long as
he lived. It seemed to me that if a man had $150 it was his
duty to pay for a substitute, if he was a hundred. The
selectmen said that they had a young fellow named Lem
Butters who was willing to go if he got a hundred and fifty.
So I planked down the money, but with the understanding
that he should take my name. Well, to make a long story
short, I got killed at Gettysburg and I wrote that out as a
reminder."</p>

<p>"Don't you ever get lonesome alone here by yourself?"
Quincy asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Uncle Ike. "I am lonesome every minute of
the time. That's what I came down here for. I got tired
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>being lonesome with other people around me, so I thought
I would come down here and be lonesome all by myself,
and I have never been sorry I came."</p>

<p>Quincy opened his eyes and looked inquiringly at Uncle
Ike.</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand what you mean by being lonesome
with other people around you," said he.</p>

<p>"No, of course you don't," replied Uncle Ike. "You are
too young. I was sixty. I was thirty-five when I got married
and my wife was only twenty-two, so when I was
sixty she was only forty-seven. One girl was twenty-three
and the other twenty. I went to work at seven o'clock in
the morning and got home at seven at night. My wife
and daughters went to theatres, dinners, and parties, and of
course I stayed at home and kept house with the servant
girl. In my business I had taken in two young fellows as
partners, both good, honest men, but soon they got to figuring
that on business points they were two and I was one,
and pretty soon all I had to do was to put wood on the fire
and feed the office cat. So you can see I was pretty lonesome
about eighteen hours out of the twenty-four."</p>

<p>Quincy said reflectively, "And your family&mdash;"</p>

<p>Uncle Ike broke in, "Are alive and well, I suppose.
They don't write me and I don't write them. I told my
partners they must buy me out, and I gave them sixty days
to do it in. I gave my wife and daughters two-thirds of
my fortune and put the other third into an annuity. I am
calculating now that if my health holds good I shall beat
the insurance company in the end."</p>

<p>Quincy, finding that his inquiries provoked such interesting
replies, risked another, "Are your daughters married?"</p>

<p>Uncle Ike laughed quietly. "I don't read the daily
papers as I said, so I don't know, but they wouldn't send
me cards anyway. They know my ideas of marriage."</p><p><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></p>

<p>Quincy, smiling, asked, "Have you some new ideas on
that old custom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," replied Uncle Ike. "If two men go into
business and each puts in money and they make money or
don't make it, the law doesn't fix it so that they must keep
together for their natural lives, but allows the firm to be
dissolved by mutual consent."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, that would make marriage a limited partnership,"
said Quincy with a smile.</p>

<p>"What better is it now?" asked Uncle Ike. "The law
doesn't compel couples to live together if they don't want
to, and if they don't want to live together, why not let
them, under proper restrictions, get up some new firms?
Of course, there wouldn't be any objection to parties living
together for their natural lives, if they wanted to, and the
fact that they did would be pretty good proof that they
wanted to."</p>

<p>Quincy started to speak, "But what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you were going to say," said Uncle Ike.
"You are going to ask that tiresome old question, what
will become of the children? Well, I should consider them
part of the property on hand and divide them and the
money according to law."</p>

<p>"But few mothers would consent to be parted from their
children."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nonsense," replied Uncle Ike. "I have a
Massachusetts State Report here that says about five hundred
children every year are abandoned by their mothers
for some cause or other. They leave them on doorsteps and
in railroad stations; they put them out to board and don't
pay their board; and the report says that every one of these
little waifs is adopted by good people, and they get a better
education and a better bringing up than their own parents
could or would give them. Have you ever read, Mr. Sawyer,
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>of the Austrian baron who was crossed in love and
decided he would never marry?"</p>

<p>Quincy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, he was wealthy and had a big castle, with no one
to live in it, and during his life he adopted, educated,
clothed, and sent out into the world, fitted to make their
own living, more than a thousand children. To my mind,
Mr. Sawyer, he was a bigger man than any emperor or king
who has ever lived."</p>

<p>Quincy asked, "But how are you going to start such a
reform, Mr. Pettengill? The first couple that got reunited
on the partnership plan would be the laughing stock of the
community."</p>

<p>"Just so," said Uncle Ike, "but I can get over that difficulty.
The State of Massachusetts has led in a great many
social reforms. Let it take the first step forward in this
one; let it declare by law that all marriages on and after a
certain day shall terminate five years from the date of
marriage unless the couples wish to renew the bonds. Then
let everybody laugh at everybody else if they want to."</p>

<p>"Well, how about those couples that were married before
that day?"</p>

<p>"That's easy," was Uncle Ike's reply. "Give them all a
chance five years after the law to dissolve by mutual consent,
if they want to. Don't forget, Mr. Sawyer, that with
such a law there would be no need of divorce courts, and
if any man insulted a woman, imprisonment for life and
even the gallows wouldn't be any too good for him. Will
you stay to lunch, Mr. Sawyer? My chicken is about done."</p>

<p>Quincy arose and politely declined the invitation, saying
he had been so much interested he had remained much
longer than he had intended, but he would be pleased to
call again some day if Mr. Pettengill were willing.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, come any time," said Uncle Ike, "you're a good
listener, and I always like a man that allows me to do most
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>of the talking. By the way, we didn't get a chance to say
much this time about shooting, fishing, or football."</p>

<p>Quincy went down the steps, and Uncle Ike stood at the
door, as he did before he entered. Swiss looked at Quincy
with an expression that seemed to say, "You have made a
pretty long call." Quincy patted him on the head, called
him "good dog," and walked briskly down the path towards
the road. When he was about fifty feet from the house,
Uncle Ike called out sharply, "Mr. Sawyer!" Quincy
turned on his heel quickly and looked towards the speaker.
Uncle Ike's voice, still sharp, spoke these farewell words:</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you, Mr. Sawyer, that I always chloroform
my chickens before I cut their heads off."</p>

<p>He stepped back into the house. Swiss, with a bound,
was in the room beside him, and when Quincy again turned
his steps towards the road the closed door had shut them
both from view.</p><p><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></p>

<h3>"THAT CITY FELLER."<br /></h3>


<p>As usual, the next morning Hiram was down to the
Pettengill house between nine and ten o'clock. He
opened the kitchen door unobserved by Mandy and looked
in at her. She was standing at the sink washing dishes
and singing to herself. Suddenly Hiram gave a jump into
the room and cried out in a loud voice, "How are you,
Mandy?"</p>

<p>She dropped a tin pan that she was wiping, which fell
with a clatter, breaking a plate that happened to be in the
sink.</p>

<p>"I'm much worse, thank you," she retorted, "and none
the better for seeing you. What do you mean by coming
into the house and yelling like a wild Injin? I shall expect
you to pay for that plate anyway."</p>

<p>"He who breaks pays," said Hiram with a laugh. "But
why don't you shake hands with a fellow?"</p>

<p>"I will if I like and I won't if I like," replied Mandy,
extending her hand, which was covered with soapsuds.</p>

<p>"Wipe your hand," said Hiram, "and I'll give you this
ten cents to pay for the plate."</p>

<p>As he said this he extended the money towards her.
Mandy did not attempt to take it, but giving her wet hand
a flip threw the soapsuds full in Hiram's face. He rushed
forward and caught her about the waist; as he did so he
dropped the money, which rolled under the kitchen table.</p>

<p>Mandy turned around quickly and facing Hiram, caught
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>him by both ears, which she pulled vigorously. He released
his hold upon her and jumped back to escape further punishment.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Hiram Maxwell," said she, facing him, "what
do you mean by such actions? I've a good mind to put
you outdoors and never set eyes on you again. What
would Mr. Pettengill have thought if he'd a come in a minute
ago?"</p>

<p>"I guess he'd a thought that I was gittin' on better'n I
really am," replied Hiram, with a crestfallen look. "Now,
Mandy, don't get mad, I didn't mean nothin', I was only
foolin' and you began it fust, by throwin' that dirty water
in my face, and no feller that had any spunk could stand
that." As he said this, a broad smile covered his face.
"Say, Mandy," he continued, "here comes Obadiah Strout,
we'd better make up before he gits in or it'll be all over
town that you and me have been fightin'. Got any chores
this mornin', Mandy, that I can do for you?"</p>

<p>At this moment the kitchen door was again opened and
Professor Strout entered.</p>

<p>"Where's Pettengill?" he asked of Mandy, not noticing
Hiram.</p>

<p>"I guess he's out in the wood-shed, if he hasn't gone
somewheres else," replied Mandy, resuming her work at
the sink.</p>

<p>Strout turned towards Hiram and said, as if he had been
unaware previously of his presence, "Oh! you there,
Hiram? Just go find Pettengill for me like a good feller
and tell him Professor Strout wishes to see him up to the
house."</p>

<p>"At the same time, Hiram," said Mandy, "go find me
that dozen eggs that I told you I wanted for that puddin'."</p>

<p>Hiram winked at Mandy, unseen by the Professor and
started for the chicken coop.</p>

<p>"Guess I'll have a chair," remarked the Professor.</p><p><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></p>

<p>"All right, if you don't take it with you when you go,"
replied Mandy, still busily washing dishes.</p>

<p>"Fine weather," said Strout.</p>

<p>"Sorter between," laconically replied Mandy.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy the concert?" asked Strout.</p>

<p>"Some parts of it," said Mandy. "I thought Mr. Sawyer
and Miss Putnam were just splendid. His whistling was
just grand."</p>

<p>"He'll whistle another kind of a tune in a few days,"
remarked Strout.</p>

<p>"What? Are you going to give another concert?" asked
Mandy, looking at him for the first time.</p>

<p>"If I do," replied the Professor, "you bet he won't be
one of the performers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Mandy, "you're mad with him 'cause
he hogged the whole show. Mr. Maxwell was just telling
me as how Mr. Sawyer was going to hire the Town Hall on
Washington's birthday and bring down a big brass band
from Boston and give a concert that would put you in the
shade, and somebody was telling me, I forget who, that
Mr. Sawyer don't like to sit 'round doing nothin', and he's
goin' to give music lessons."</p>

<p>These last two untruthful shots hit the mark, as she
knew they would, and Strout, abandoning the subject,
blurted out, "Where in thunder's that Hiram? I'll be
blowed if I don't believe he went to look for the eggs first."</p>

<p>"I reckon he did," said Mandy, "if he means to keep on
good terms with me. He ain't likely to tend to stray jobs
till he's done up his regular chores."</p>

<p>"I s'pose Deacon Mason sends him down here to wait on
you?" remarked Strout with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Did Deacon Mason tell you that you could have him to
run your errands?" inquired Mandy, with a pout.</p>

<p>"Guess the best thing I can do," said Strout rising, "is
to go hunt Pettengill up myself."</p><p><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></p>

<p>"I guess you've struck it right this time," assented
Mandy, as Strout left the room and started for the wood-shed.</p>

<p>As he closed the door, Mandy resumed her singing as
though such conversations were of everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>She finished her work at the sink and was fixing the
kitchen fire when Hiram returned.</p>

<p>"All I could find," said he, holding an egg in each hand.
"The hens must have struck or think it's a holiday. S'pose
there's any out in the barn? Come, let's go look, Mandy.
Where's old Strout?"</p>

<p>"I guess he's gone to look for Mr. Pettengill," replied
Mandy, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I kinder thought he would if I stayed long enough,"
said Hiram, with a grin; "but come along, Mandy, no hen
fruit, no puddin'."</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell," said Mandy, soberly, "I wish you'd be
more particular about your language. You know I abominate
slang. You know how careful I try to be."</p>

<p>"You're a dandy," said Hiram, taking her hand.</p>

<p>They ran as far as the wood-shed, when seeing the door
open, they hid behind it until Strout came out and walked
down towards the lane to meet Ezekiel, whom he had seen
coming up from the road. Then Hiram and Mandy sped
on their way to the barn, which they quickly reached and
were soon upon the haymow, apparently searching intently
for eggs.</p>

<p>When Strout reached Ezekiel he shook hands with him
and said, "Come up to the barn, Pettengill, I've got a little
somethin' I want to tell you and it's kinder private. It's
about that city feller that's swellin' round here puttin' on
airs and tryin' to make us think that his father is a bigger
man than George Washington. He about the same as
told me down to the grocery store that the blood of all the
Quincys flowed in one arm and the blood of all the Adams
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>in the other, but I kinder guess that the rest of his carcass
is full of calf's blood and there's more fuss and feathers
than fight to him."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the barn and they sat down
upon a pile of hay at the foot of the mow.</p>

<p>"Now my plan's this," said Strout. "You know Bob
Wood; well, he's the biggest feller and the best fighter in
town. I'm goin' to post Bob up as to how to pick a quarrel
with that city feller. When he gets the lickin' that he
deserves, I rayther think that Deacon Mason will lose a
boarder."</p>

<p>"But s'posin' Mr. Sawyer licks Bob Wood?" queried
Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't count much on that," said Strout; "but if
it should turn out that way we're goin' to turn in and get
up a surprise party for Miss Mason and jist leave him out."</p>

<p>"I hope you ain't goin' to do any fightin' down to Deacon
Mason's?" remarked Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" protested Strout, "it'll be kind o' quiet, underminin'
work, as it were. Remarks and sayin's and side
whispers and odd looks, the cold shoulder business, you
know, that soon tells a feller that his company ain't
appreciated."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think that's quite fair," said Ezekiel. "You
don't like him, Mr. Strout, but I don't think the whole town
will take it up."</p>

<p>The Professor said sternly, "He has insulted me and in
doing that he has insulted the whole town of Eastborough."</p>

<p>A smothered laugh was heard.</p>

<p>"By George! What was that?" cried Strout.</p>

<p>Ezekiel was at a loss what to say, and before he could
reply, Mandy's laughing had caused the hay to move. As
it began to slide she clutched at Hiram in a vain effort to
save herself, and the next instant a large pile of hay, bearing<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
Hiram and Mandy, came down, falling upon Ezekiel
and Strout and covering them from sight.</p>

<p>When all had struggled to their feet, Ezekiel turned to
Mandy and said sharply, "What were you doin' up there,
Mandy?"</p>

<p>"Looking for eggs," said she, as she ran out of the barn
and started for the house.</p>

<p>Hiram stood with his mouth distended with a huge smile.
Strout turned towards him and said savagely, "Well, if
you're the only egg she got, 'twas a mighty bad one."</p>

<p>Hiram retorted, "I would rather be called a bad egg
than somethin' I heard about you."</p>

<p>Strout, in a passion, cried out, "Who said anything about
me?"</p>

<p>Hiram made for the barn door and then said, "heard a
gentleman say as how there was only one jackass in Eastborough
and he taught the singin' school."</p>

<p>Strout caught up a rake to throw at him, but Hiram was
out of sight before he could carry out his purpose. Turning
to Ezekiel, Strout said, "I bet a dollar, Pettengill, it
was that city feller that said that, and as I have twice remarked
and this makes three times, this town ain't big
enough to hold both on us."</p><p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></p>

<h3>CITY SKILL VERSUS COUNTRY MUSCLE.<br /></h3>

<p>Hiram Maxwell was not called upon to perform
very arduous duties at Deacon Mason's. The Deacon
had given up farming several years before, and Hiram's
duties consisted in doing the chores about the house. He
had plenty of spare time, and he used it by going down to
the Pettengill place and talking to Mandy Skinner.</p>

<p>The next morning after the adventure in the barn, Hiram
went down as usual after his morning's work was done to
see Mandy.</p>

<p>"How do you find things, Mandy?" said Hiram, opening
the kitchen door and putting his head in.</p>

<p>"By looking for them," said Mandy, without looking up
from her work.</p>

<p>"You are awful smart, ain't you?" retorted Hiram.</p>

<p>Mandy replied, "People's opinion that I think a good deal
more of than yours have said that same thing, Mr. Maxwell."</p>

<p>Hiram saw that he was worsted, so he changed the conversation.</p>

<p>"Anybody to hum?"</p>

<p>Mandy answered sharply, "Everybody's out but me, of
course I am nobody."</p>

<p>Hiram came in and closed the door.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so pesky smart with your tongue,
Mandy. Of course I can't keep up with you and you know
it. What's up?"</p><p><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></p>

<p>Mandy replied, "The thermometer. It isn't nearly as
cold as it was yesterday."</p>

<p>Hiram, seeing a breakfast apparently laid out on a side
table inquired, "Expectin' somebody to breakfast?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mandy, "I got that ready for Mr. Pettengill,
but he didn't have time to eat it because he was afraid he
would lose the train."</p>

<p>"Has he gone to the city?" asked Hiram.</p>

<p>"I 'spect he has," answered Mandy.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Hiram, "s'posin' I eat that breakfast
myself, so as to save you the trouble of throwin' it away."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mandy, "I was going to give it to the pigs;
I suppose one hog might as well have it as another."</p>

<p>Hiram said, "Why, you don't call me a big eater, do you,
Mandy?"</p>

<p>Mandy laughed and said, "I can't tell, I never saw you
when you wasn't hungry. How do you know when you
have got enough?"</p>

<p>Hiram said, "I haven't got but one way of tellin', I allus
eats till it hurts me, then I stop while the pain lasts."</p>

<p>Then he asked Mandy, "What did 'Zekiel go to the city
for?"</p>

<p>Mandy answered, "Mr. Pettengill does not confide his
private business to me."</p>

<p>Hiram broke in, "I bet a dollar you know why he went,
just the same."</p>

<p>Mandy said, "I bet a dollar I do."</p>

<p>Then she broke into a loud laugh. Hiram evidently
thought it was very funny and laughed until the tears stood
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing for?" asked Mandy.</p>

<p>Hiram's countenance fell.</p>

<p>"Come down to the fine point, Mandy, durned if I
know."</p>

<p>"That's a great trick of yours, Hiram," said Mandy.<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>
"You ought not to laugh at anything unless you understand
it."</p>

<p>"I guess I wouldn't laugh much then," said Hiram. "I
allus laugh when I don't understand anythin', so folks
won't think that I don't know where the p'int domes in.
But say, Mandy, what did Pettengill go to the city for?"</p>

<p>During this conversation Hiram had been eating the
breakfast that had been prepared for Ezekiel. Mandy sat
down near him and said, "I'll tell you, but it ain't nothing
to laugh at. Mr. Pettengill had a telegraph message come
last night."</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" said Hiram. "It must be pretty
important for persons to spend money that way. Nobody
dead, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mandy, "Mr. Pettengill left the telegram in
his room and I had to read it to see whether I had to throw
it away or not, and I remember every word that was in it."</p>

<p>Hiram asked earnestly, "Well, what was it? Is his sister
Alice goin' to get married?"</p>

<p>Mandy answered, "No, she is sick and she wanted him
to come right up to Boston at once to see her."</p>

<p>Hiram said, "'Zekiel must think a powerful lot of that
sister of his'n. Went right off to Boston without his breakfast."</p>

<p>"I guess it would have to be something nearer than a
sister to make you do that," said Mandy. "I don't know but
one thing, Hiram, that would make you go without your
feed."</p>

<p>"What's that, Mandy?" said he. "You?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mandy, "a famine."</p>

<p>"You ain't no sort of an idea as to what's the matter
with her, have you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Mandy, "and if I had I don't imagine
I would tell you. Now you better run right home,
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>little boy, for I have to go upstairs and do the chamber
work."</p>

<p>She whisked out of the room, and Hiram, helping himself
to a couple of apples, left the house and walked slowly
along the road towards Eastborough Centre.</p>

<p>Suddenly he espied a man coming up the road and soon
saw it was Quincy Adams Sawyer.</p>

<p>"Just the feller I wanted to see," soliliquized Hiram.</p>

<p>As Quincy reached him he said, "Mr. Sawyer, I want
to speak to you a minute or two. Come into Pettengill's
barn, there's nobody to hum but Mandy and she's upstairs
makin' the beds."</p>

<p>They entered the barn and sat down on a couple of half
barrels that served for stools.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer, you've treated me fust rate since you've
been here and I want to do you a good turn and put you
on your guard."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed.</p>

<p>Hiram continued, "Well, maybe you won't laugh if Bob
Wood tackles you. I won't tell you how I found it out
for I'm no eavesdropper, but keep your eye on Bob Wood
and look out he don't play no mean tricks on you."</p>

<p>Quincy remarked, "I suppose Mr. Strout is at the bottom
of this and he has hired this Bob Wood to do what he can't
do himself."</p>

<p>"I guess you have got it about right, Mr. Sawyer," said
Hiram. "Can you fight?" he asked of Quincy.</p>

<p>"I am a good shot with a rifle," Quincy replied. "I can
hit the ace of hearts at one hundred feet with a pistol."</p>

<p>"I don't mean that," said Hiram. "Can you fight with
yer fists?"</p>

<p>"I don't know much about it," said Quincy with a queer
smile.</p>

<p>"Then I am afraid you will find Bob Wood a pretty
tough customer. He can lick any two fellers in town. Why,
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>he polished off Cobb's twins one day in less than five minutes,
both of 'em."</p>

<p>"Where does this Bob Wood spend most of his time?"
asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"He loafs around Hill's grocery. When he ain't wokin'
at his trade," said Hiram, "he does odd jobs for the Putnams
in summer and cuts some wood for them in winter.
You know Lindy Putnam, the gal you sang with at the
concert?"</p>

<p>"Come along," said Quincy, "I feel pretty good this
morning, we'll walk down to Hill's and see if that Mr.
Wood has anything to say to me."</p>

<p>"Don't you think the best plan, Mr. Sawyer, would be
to keep out of his way?" queried Hiram.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell that," said Quincy, "until I get better
acquainted with him. After that he may think he'd better
keep out of my way."</p>

<p>"Why, he's twice as big as you," cried Hiram, with a
look of astonishment on his face.</p>

<p>"Come along, Hiram," said Quincy. "By the way, I
haven't seen Miss Putnam since the concert. I think I
will have to call on her."</p>

<p>Hiram laughed until his face was as red as a beet.</p>

<p>"By gum, that's good," he said, as he struck both legs
with his hands.</p>

<p>"What's good?" asked Quincy. "Calling on Miss Putnam?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hiram. "Wouldn't she be s'prised?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Quincy. "Such a call wouldn't be considered
anything out of the way in the city."</p>

<p>"No, nor it wouldn't here," said Hiram, "but for the fact
that Miss Putnam don't encourage callers. She goes round
a visitin' herself, and she treats the other girls fust rate,
'cause she has plenty of money and can afford it. But she
has got two good reasons for not wantin' visitors."</p><p><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></p>

<p>"What are they?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm country myself," said Hiram, "and there are
others in Eastborough that are more country than I am.
But if you want to see and hear the genooine old Rubes
you want to see old Sy Putnam and his wife Heppy."</p>

<p>"But Miss Mason said Miss Putnam was quite wealthy."</p>

<p>"You bet she is," said Hiram. "She's worth hundreds
of millions of dollars."</p>

<p>"I think you must mean thousands," remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, as far as I'm concerned," said Hiram, "when you
talk about millions or thousands of money, one's just the
same to me as t'other. I never seed so much money in my
life as I seed since you've been here, but I don't want you to
think I'm beggin' for more."</p>

<p>"No," said Quincy, "I should never impute such a motive
to you."</p>

<p>Quincy took a dollar bill from his pocket and held it up
before Hiram.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That's one hundred cents," said Hiram, "considerably
more than I have got."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "if you tell me why Miss Putnam
doesn't like callers I will give you that dollar."</p>

<p>"Stop a minute," replied Hiram. "Soon as we turn this
next corner we'll be in full sight of the grocery store. You
can go ahead and I'll slip 'cross lots and come up from
behind the store. If Wood thought I'd told you he would
lick me and I'm no fighter. Now about Miss Putnam,"
dropping his voice, "I heard it said, and I guess it's pretty
near the truth, that she is so blamed stuck up and dresses
so fine in city fashions that she is just 'shamed of her old
pa and ma and don't want nobody to see 'em."</p>

<p>"But," asked Quincy, "where did she get her money?"</p>

<p>Hiram answered, "From her only brother. He went
down to Boston, made a pile of money, then died and left
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>it all to Lindy. If what I've told you ain't gospel truth it's
mighty near it. Well, I'll see you later, Mr. Sawyer."</p>

<p>And Hiram ran down a path that led across the fields.</p>

<p>Quincy turned the corner and walked briskly towards
Hill's grocery store. A dozen or more young men and as
many older ones were lounging about the platform that
ran the whole length of the store, for it was a very mild
day in January, and the snow was rapidly leaving under the
influence of what might be called a January thaw.</p>

<p>Quincy walked through the crowd, giving a friendly nod
to several faces that looked familiar, but the names of whose
owners were unknown to him. He entered the store, found
a letter from his mother and another from his sister Gertie,
and saying "Good morning" to Mr. Hill, who was the
village postmaster, soon reached the platform again.</p>

<p>As he did so a heavily built young fellow, fully six feet
tall and having a coarse red face, stepped up to him and
said brusquely, "I believe your name's Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Your belief is well founded," replied Quincy. "I regret
that I do not know your name."</p>

<p>"Well, you won't have to suffer long before you find out,"
said the fellow. "My name's Robert Wood, or Bob Wood
for short."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," said Quincy. "Robert for long wood and
Bob for short wood."</p>

<p>Wood's face grew redder.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you think that's mighty smart makin' fun of
folks' names. I guess there ain't much doubt but what you
said what a friend of mine tells me you did."</p>

<p>Quincy remarked calmly, "Well, what did your friend
say I said about you?"</p>

<p>By this time the loungers in and outside the store had
gathered around the two talkers. Wood seemed encouraged
and braced up by the presence of so many friends.
He walked up close to Quincy and said, "Well, my friend
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>told me that you said there was but one jackass in Eastborough
and he sang bass in the quartette."</p>

<p>Quincy paled a little, but replied firmly, "I never said
it, and if your friend says I did he lies and he knows it."</p>

<p>At this juncture, as if prearranged, Obadiah Strout suddenly
emerged from the grocery store.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, gentlemen?" asked Mr. Strout.</p>

<p>"Well," said Wood, "I told this young man what you
said he said, and he says you're a liar."</p>

<p>"Well," said Strout pompously, "I know that he said it
and I have witnesses to prove it. When you settle with
him for calling you a jackass I'll settle with him for calling
me a liar."</p>

<p>"Take your coat off, Mr. Sawyer, and get ready. I won't
keep you waitin' but a few moments," said Bob.</p>

<p>A jeering laugh went up from the crowd. Quincy, turning,
saw Hiram.</p>

<p>"Here, Hiram," said he, "hold my things."</p>

<p>He took off his overcoat and then his black Prince Albert
coat and passed them to Hiram. Then he removed his hat,
which he also handed to Hiram.</p>

<p>Turning to Wood he said, "Come right out here, Mr.
Wood; here is a place where the sun has kindly removed
the snow and we can get a good footing."</p>

<p>Wood followed him, and the crowd formed a ring about
them.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Wood, or perhaps I should say Bob Wood
for short, put up your hands."</p>

<p>Bob put them up in defiance of all rules governing boxing.
This was enough for Quincy; he had sized up his man
and determined to make the most of his opportunity.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wood," he said politely, "before I hit you I am
going to tell you just exactly where I am going to strike,
so you can't blame me for anything that may happen. I
shall commence on your right eye."</p><p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></p>

<p>Wood's face grew livid; he made a rush at Quincy as
though he would fall on him and crush him. Quincy easily
eluded him, and when Wood made his second rush at him
he parried a right-hander, and before Wood could recover,
he struck him a square blow full on his right eye. They
faced each other again.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Wood," said Quincy, "I see you have a watch
in your vest pocket. Is it an open-faced watch?"</p>

<p>"S'posin' you find out," said Wood, glaring at Quincy
with his left eye, his right one being closed up.</p>

<p>"Well, then," remarked Quincy, "you will be obliged to
have it repaired, for I am going to hit you just where
that watch is and it may injure it."</p>

<p>Wood was more wary this time and Quincy was more
scientific. He gave Wood a left-hander in the region of
the heart which staggered him.</p>

<p>They faced each other for the third time.</p>

<p>"I regret the necessity this time, but I will be obliged to
strike you full in the face and in my excitement may hit
your nose."</p>

<p>It required all of Quincy's dexterity to avoid the wild
rushes and savage thrusts made by Wood. But Quincy
understood every one of the boxer's secrets and was as
light and agile on his feet as a cat. It was three minutes
at least before Quincy got the desired opening, and then
he landed a blow on Wood's nose that sent him flat upon
his back.</p>

<p>"That's enough," cried the crowd, and several friends
led Wood to a seat on the platform.</p>

<p>Quincy turned to Strout. "Now, Mr. Strout, I am at
your service."</p>

<p>"No, sir," said Strout, "I am willing to fight a gentleman,
but I don't fight with no professional prize fighter
like you." Turning to the crowd: "I know all about this
fellow. He is no lawyer at all, he is a regular prize fighter,<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>and down in Boston he is known by the name of Billy
Shanks."</p>

  <p class="caption">And Then He Landed A Blow On Wood's Nose</p>

<p>Quincy smiled. Turning to the crowd he said, "The
statement just made by Mr. Strout is like his statement to
Mr. Wood. The first was a lie, the second is a lie, and the
man who uttered them is a liar. Good morning, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Quincy went to Hiram, who helped him on with his
coats. They walked along together. After they turned
the corner and got out of sight of the grocery store, Hiram
said:</p>

<p>"Geewhilikins! What a smasher you gave him. I
thought you said you didn't know nothin' about fightin'."</p>

<p>"I don't know much," responded Quincy. "There are
a dozen men in Boston who could do to me just exactly
what I did to Bob Wood."</p><p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></p>

<h3>MR. SAWYER CALLS ON MISS PUTNAM.<br /></h3>

<p>Quincy had a double purpose in calling on Lindy;
he actually wished to see her, for they had not met
since the concert, but his principal wish was to meet a real
old-fashioned country couple. To be sure, Deacon Mason
and his wife often dropped into the vernacular, but the
Deacon was a very dignified old gentleman and his wife
was not a great talker. What he desired was to find one
of the old-fashioned style of country women, with a tongue
hung in the middle and running at both ends. His wish
was to be gratified.</p>

<p>When he clanged the old brass knocker on the door,
Samanthy Green answered the call.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Putnam at home?" asked Quincy politely.</p>

<p>"No, she ain't," said Samanthy, "but Mr. and Mrs. Putnam
is. They're allus to hum. They don't go nowheres
from one year's end to t'other."</p>

<p>"I would like to see them," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Samanthy, "walk right in."</p>

<p>She threw open the door of the sitting-room. "Here's
a gentleman that wants to see you, Mas' Putnam. Leastwise
he asked for Lindy fust."</p>

<p>Samanthy left the room, slamming the door after her.</p>

<p>"My name is Sawyer," said Quincy, addressing the old
lady and gentleman who were seated in rocking chairs.
"I met your daughter at the concert given at the Town
Hall New-Year's night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam said, "Glad to see ye, Mr. Sawyer; have a
chair."</p><p><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></p>

<p>As Quincy laid his hand upon the chair, the old gentleman
called out in a voice that would have startled a bull of
Bashan, "What's his name, Heppy?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam answered in a shrill voice with an edge like
a knife, "Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Sawyer!" yelled the man. "Any relation to Jim Sawyer
that got drunk, beat his wife, starved his children, and
finally ended up in the town Poorhouse?"</p>

<p>Quincy shook his head and replied, "I think not. I don't
live here; I live in Boston."</p>

<p>"Du tell," said Mrs. Putnam. "How long you been
here?"</p>

<p>Quincy replied that he arrived two days after Christmas.</p>

<p>"Where be you stoppin'?" asked Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>Quincy answered, "I am boarding at Deacon Mason's."</p>

<p>"He's a nice old gentleman," said Mrs. Putnam, "and
Mrs. Mason's good as they make 'em. Her daughter
Huldy's a pert young thing, she's pretty and she knows it."</p>

<p>Quincy remarked that he thought Miss Mason was a
very nice young lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Mrs. Putnam, "you young fellers never
look more than skin deep. Now the way she trifles with
that young 'Zekiel Pettengill I think's shameful. They ust
to have a spat every week about something but they allus
made it up. But I heard Lindy say that after you come
here, 'Zeke he got huffy and Huldy she got independent,
and they hain't spoke to each other nigh on two weeks."</p>

<p>This was a revelation to Quincy, but he was to hear more
about it very soon.</p>

<p>"How long be you goin' to stay, Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I haven't decided," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"What's your business?" persisted Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"I am a lawyer," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam looked at him inquiringly and said, "Be n't
you rather young for a lawyer? How old be you, anyway?"</p><p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></p>

<p>Quincy decided to take a good humored part in his cross
examination and said without a smile, "I am twenty-three
years, two months, sixteen days old."</p>

<p>"Be you?" exclaimed Mrs. Putnam. "I shouldn't have
said you were a day over nineteen."</p>

<p>Quincy never felt his youth so keenly before. He determined
to change the conversation.</p>

<p>"Did you attend the concert, Mrs. Putnam?"</p>

<p>"No," said she. "Pa and me don't go out much; he's
deefer'n a stone post and I've had the rheumatiz so bad in
my knees for the last five years that I can't walk without
crutches;" and she pointed to a pair that lay on the floor
beside her chair.</p>

<p>During this conversation old Mr. Putnam had been eying
Quincy very keenly. He blurted out, "He's a chip of the
old block, Heppy; he looks just as Jim did when he fust
came to this town. Did yer say yer had an Uncle Jim?"</p>

<p>Quincy shook his head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam turned to her husband and yelled, "Now
you shet up, Silas, and don't bother the young man. Jim
Sawyer ain't nothin' to be proud of, and I don't blame the
young man for not ownin' up even if Jim is his uncle."</p>

<p>Quincy made another attempt to change the conversation.
"Your daughter is a very fine singer, Mrs. Putnam."</p>

<p>"Well, I s'pose so," said she; "there's been enough
money spent on her to make suthin' of her. As for me I
don't like this folderol singin'. Why, when she ust to be
practisin' I had to go up in the attic or else stuff cotton
in my ears. But my son, Jehoiakim Jones Putnam, he sot
everythin' by Lucinda, and there wasn't anythin' she
wanted that she couldn't have. He's dead now, but he
left more'n a hundred thousand dollars, that he made speculatin'."</p>

<p>"Then your daughter will be quite an heiress one of
these days, Mrs. Putnam?"</p><p><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></p>

<p>She answered, "She won't get none of my money.
Jehoiakim left her all of his'n, but before she got it she had
to sign a paper, a wafer, I believe they call it, if you're a
lawyer you ought to know what it was, givin' up all claim
on my money. I made my will and the girl who'll get it
needs it and will make good use of it."</p>

<p>Quincy determined to get even with Mrs. Putnam for
the questioning she put him through, so he said, "Did you
make your money speculating, Mrs. Putnam?"</p>

<p>"No," said she, "pa made it by hard work on the farm;
but he gave it all to me more'n fifteen year ago, and he
hasn't got a cent to his name. He's just as bad off as Jim
Sawyer. I feed him and clothe him and shall have to bury
him. I guess it seems kinder odd to ye, so I reckon I'll
have to tell ye the hull story. I've told it a dozen times,
but I guess it'll bear tellin' once more. You see my husband
here, Silas Putnam, was brought up religis and he's
allus been a churchgoin' man. We were both Methodists,
and everythin' went all right till one day a Second Advent
preacher came along, and then things went all wrong. He
canoodled my husband into believin' that the end of the
world was comin' and it was his duty to give all his property
away, so he could stand clean handed afore the Lord.
My dander riz when I heerd them makin' their plans, but
afore my husband got deef he was great on argifyin' and
argumentin', and I didn't stand much show against two on
'em; but when Silas told me he was goin' to give his property
away I sot up my Ebenezer, and I says, 'Silas Putnam,
if you gives your property to any one you gives it to me.'
So after a long tussle it was settled that way and the lawyers
drew up the papers. The night afore the world was goin'
to end he prayed all night. You can imagine with that air
voice of his'n I didn't sleep a wink. When mornin' came&mdash;it
was late in October and the air was pretty sharp&mdash;Silas
stopped prayin' and put on his white robe, which was a
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>shirt of hisn't I pieced out so it came down to his feet, and
takin' a tin trumpet that he bought over to Eastborough
Centre, he went out, climbed up on the barn, sot down on
the ridgepole and waited for Kingdom Come. He sot
there and tooted all mornin' and 'spected the angel Gabriel
would answer back. He sot there and tooted all the arternoon
till the cows come home and the chickens went to
roost. I had three good square meals that day, but Silas
didn't get a bite. 'Bout six o'clock I did think of takin'
him out some doughnuts, but then I decided if he was goin'
up so soon it was no use a wastin' em, so I put 'em back in
the pantry. He sot there and tooted all the evenin' till the
moon come up and the stars were all out, and then he slid
down off'n the barn, and barked both his shins doin' it,
threw his trumpet into the pig pen, come into the house and
huddled up close to the fire. He didn't say nothin' for a
spell, but finally says he, 'I guess, Heppy, that feller made a
mistake in figurin' out the date.' 'I guess, Silas,' says I,
'that you've made an all-fired fool of yerself. And if you
don't go to bed quick and take a rum sweat, I shall be a
widder in a very short time,' He was sick for more'n three
weeks, but I pulled him through by good nussin', and the
fust day he was able to set up, I says to him, 'Now, Silas
Putnam, when I married ye forty-five year ago I promised
to obey ye, ye was allus a good perwider and I don't perpose
to see yer want for nothin', but ye have got to hold up
yer right hand and swear to obey me for the rest of yer
nateral life,' and he did it. He got well, and he is tougher'n
a biled owl, if he is eighty-six. But the cold sorter settled in
his ears, and he's deef as an adder. Ef angel Gabriel blew
his horn now I'm afeared Silas wouldn't hear him."</p>

<p>During this long story Quincy had listened without a
smile on his face, but the manner in which the last remark
was made was too much for him and he burst into a loud
laugh. Silas, who had been eying him, also gave a loud
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>laugh and said with his ponderous voice, "I guess Heppy's
been tellin' ye about my goin' up."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed again and Mrs. Putnam took part. He
arose, told Mr. and Mrs. Putnam he had enjoyed his visit
very much, was very sorry Miss Putnam was not at home,
and said he would call again, with their kind permission.</p>

<p>"Oh, drop in any time," said Mrs. Putnam; "we're allus
to hum. You seem to be a nice young man, but you're too
young to marry. Why, Lindy's twenty-eight, and I tell her
she don't know enough to get married yet. Ef you'll take
a bit of advice from an old woman, let me say, 'less you
mean to marry the girl yourself, you'd better git away from
Deacon Mason's."</p>

<p>And with this parting shot ringing in his ears, he left
the house and made his way homeward.</p>

<p>In half an hour after Quincy's departure, Lindy Putnam
entered the sitting-room and facing her mother said with a
voice full of passion, "Samanthy says Mr. Sawyer called to
see me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam answered, "Well, ef ye wanted to see him
so much why didn't ye stay to hum?"</p>

<p>Lindy continued, "Well, I have told you a dozen times
that when people come to see me that you are not to invite
them in."</p>

<p>"Wall, I didn't," said Mrs. Putnam. "When he found
you wuz out he said he wanted to see pa and me, and he
stayed here more'n an hour."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lindy, "no doubt you told him all about pa's
turning Second Advent and how much money I had, and
you have killed all my chances."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess not," said Mrs. Putnam. "I told him
about your brother leavin' yer all his money, and I guess
that won't drive him away."</p>

<p>Lindy continued, "Money don't count with him; they
say his father is worth more than a million dollars."</p><p><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam answered, "Wall, I s'pose there's a dozen
or so to divide it among."</p>

<p>Lindy said, "Did you tell him who you were going to
leave your money to?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," replied Mrs. Putnam. "But I did tell
him that you wouldn't get a cent of it."</p>

<p>Lindy sobbed, "I think it is a shame, mother. I like him
better than any young man I have ever met, and now after
what you have told me I sha'n't see him again. I have a
good mind to leave you for good and all and go to Boston
to live."</p>

<p>"Wall, you're your own mistress," replied Mrs. Putnam,
"and I'm my own mistress and pa's. Come to think on't,
there was one thing I said to him that might sot him against
yer."</p>

<p>"What was that?" demanded Lindy fiercely.</p>

<p>"Wall," said Mrs. Putnam, "he said he was twenty-three,
and I sort a told him incidentally you was twenty-eight.
You know yer thirty, and p'raps he might object to ye on
account of yer age."</p>

<p>This was too much for Lindy. She rushed out of the
room and up to her chamber, where she threw herself on
her bed in a passion of tears.</p>

<p>"It's too bad," she cried. "I will see him again, I will
find some way, and I'll win him yet, even if I am twenty-eight."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards Hiram told Mandy that he heard
down to Hill's grocery that that city chap had two strings
to his bow now. He was courting the Deacon's daughter,
but had been up to see Mr. and Mrs. Putnam to find out
how much money Lindy had in her own right, and to see
if there was any prospect of getting anything out of the
old folks.</p><p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></p>

<h3>VILLAGE GOSSIP.<br /></h3>

<p>After supper on the day he had been visiting Mr.
and Mrs. Putnam, Quincy went to his room and
wrote a long letter to his father, inquiring if he ever had an
uncle by the name of James Sawyer. Before retiring he sat
and thought over the experiences of the past fortnight since
his arrival in Eastborough, but the most of his thoughts
were given to the remark made by Mrs. Putnam about his
leaving Deacon Mason's. He had been uniformly polite
and to a slight degree attentive to Miss Mason. The Deacon's
horse was a slow one, and so on several occasions he
had hired a presentable rig and a good stepper over to
Eastborough Centre, and had taken Miss Mason out to ride.
He reflected now, as he had never done before, that of
course the whole town knew this, and the thought came
home to him strongly that by so doing he might have inflicted
a triple injury upon Miss Mason, Mr. Pettingill, and
himself. He was not in love with Miss Mason, nor Miss
Putnam; they were both pretty girls, and in the city it was
the custom to be attentive to pretty girls without regard to
consequences.</p>

<p>He had asked Miss Mason to go riding with him the next
day, but he inwardly resolved that it would be the last time
he would take her, and he was in doubt whether to go back
to the city at once or go to some other town and board at a
hotel, or look around and find some other place in Eastborough.
One consideration kept him from leaving<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>
Eastborough; he knew that if he did so the singing-master
would claim that he had driven him out of town, and
although he had a hearty contempt for the man, he was
too high spirited to leave town and give the people any
reason to think that Strout's antipathy to him had anything
to do with it.</p>

<p>Finally a bright idea struck him. Why hadn't he
thought of it before? He would go and see Uncle Ike,
state the case frankly and ask him to let him live with him
for a month. He could bunk in the kitchen, and he preferred
Uncle Ike's conversation to that of any other of the
male sex whom he had met in Eastborough. With this
idea firmly fixed in his mind he retired and slept peacefully.</p>

<p>While Quincy was debating with himself and coming to
the conclusion previously mentioned, another conversation,
in which his name often occurred, took place in Deacon
Mason's kitchen.</p>

<p>The old couple were seated by the old-fashioned fireplace,
in which a wood fire was burning. The stove had superseded
the hanging crane and the tin oven for cooking purposes,
but Deacon Mason clung to the old-fashioned fireplace
for heat and light. The moon was high and its rays
streamed in through the windows, the curtains of which
had not been drawn.</p>

<p>For quite a while they sat in silence, then Deacon Mason
said, "There is something I want to speak about, mother,
and yet I don't want to. I know there is nothing to it and
nothing likely to come of it, but the fact is, mother, Huldy's
bein' talked about down to the Corner, 'cause Mr. Sawyer is
boardin' here. You know she goes out ridin' with him,
which ain't no harm, and she has a sort o' broken with
'Zekiel, for which I am sorry, for 'Zekiel is one of the likely
young men of the town."</p>

<p>"So I do, father," said Mrs. Mason, "and if you don't
meddle, things will come out all right. Mr. Sawyer don't
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>care nothing for Huldy, and I don't think she cares anything
for him. He will be going back to the city in a little
while and then things will be all right again."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Deacon, "I think Huldy better stop
goin' out to ride with him anyway; she is high spirited,
and if I tell her not to go she'll want to know why."</p>

<p>"But," broke in Mrs. Mason, "ef you tell him won't he
want to know why?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps," said the Deacon, "but I will speak to
him anyway."</p>

<p>The next morning after breakfast Deacon Mason asked
Mr. Sawyer to step into the parlor, and remarking that
when he had anything to say he always said it right out, he
asked Quincy if he was on good terms with Mr. 'Zekiel
Pettengill.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Quincy. "I don't know of anything
that I have done at which he could take offence, but he
keeps away from me, and when I do meet him and speak
to him, a 'yes' or 'no' is all I get in reply."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any idea what makes him treat you so?"
asked the Deacon.</p>

<p>Quincy flushed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Mason, I think I do know, but it never entered
my mind until late yesterday afternoon, and then it
was called to my attention by a stranger. I am glad I have
this chance to speak to you, Mr. Mason, for while I have
had a very enjoyable time here, I have decided to find
another boarding place, and I shall leave just as soon as I
make the necessary arrangements."</p>

<p>The Deacon was a little crestfallen at having the business
taken out of his hands so quickly, and saying he was very
sorry to have the young man go, he sought his wife and told
her everything was fixed up and that Mr. Sawyer was going
away.</p>

<p>Quincy started to leave the house by the front door; in
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>the hallway he met Huldy, who had just come down stairs.
He had asked her to go to ride with him that day, and as he
looked at her pretty face he vowed to himself that he would
not be deprived of that pleasure. It could do no harm, for
it would be their last ride together and probably their last
meeting.</p>

<p>He said, "Good morning, Miss Mason," and then added
with that tone which the society belle considers a matter of
course, but which is so pleasing to the village maiden,
"You look charming this morning, Miss Mason. I don't
think our ride to-day could make your cheeks any redder
than they are now." Huldy blushed, making her cheeks a
still deeper crimson. "I will be here at one o'clock with
the team," said Quincy. "Will you be ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Huldy softly.</p>

<p>Quincy raised his hat, and a moment later he was on his
way to Eastborough Centre.</p>

<p>He walked briskly and thought he would stop at Uncle
Ike's and carry out the resolution he had made the night
before, but as he turned up the path that led to the house he
saw a man standing on the steps talking to Uncle Ike, who
stood in the doorway. The young man was Ezekiel Pettengill.
Shakespeare says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Tis conscience that makes cowards of us all,"</p></div>

<p>and although Quincy at heart was a gentleman, he also
knew it was not quite right for him to take Miss Mason out
riding again under the circumstances; but young men are
often stubborn and Quincy felt a little stiff-necked and
rebellious that morning.</p>

<p>He reached Eastborough Centre, mailed his father the
letter relating to Jim Sawyer, and going to the stable,
picked out the best rig it could supply. He always had the
same horse. It was somewhat small in size, but a very
plump, white mare; she was a good roadster and it was
never necessary to touch her with the whip. Shake it in
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>the stock and she would not forget it for the next two miles.
The stable keeper told with much unction how two fellows
hired her to go from Eastborough Centre to Montrose. On
their way home they had drunk quite freely at the latter
place, and thought they would touch the mare up with the
whip; they were in an open team and the result was that
she left them at different points along the road and reached
home with no further impediment to her career than the
shafts and the front wheels.</p>

<p>Instead of coming back by the main road which led by
Uncle Ike's, Quincy went through by what was called The
Willows, which increased the distance a couple of miles.
Nevertheless, it lacked five minutes of one o'clock when he
drove up to Deacon Mason's front door.</p>

<p>Huldy was all dressed for the occasion, and with a "Good-by,
mother," to Mrs. Mason, who was in the kitchen, was
out the front door, helped into the team, and they were off
just as the startled matron reached the parlor window.
Mrs. Mason returned to the kitchen and at that moment the
Deacon came in from the barn.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, mother?" asked the Deacon, noticing
her excited and somewhat troubled look.</p>

<p>"Huldy is gone out riding again with Mr. Sawyer," said
she.</p>

<p>The Deacon was a good Christian man and didn't swear,
but he was evidently thinking deeply. Finally he said,
"Well, mother, we must make the best of it. I'll help
him find a boarding place if he don't get one by to-morrow."</p>

<p>They had a splendid drive. The air was cool, but not
biting, the sun was warm, the roads had dried up since the
recent thaw, which had removed the snow, with the exception
of some patches in the fields, and the high-topped
buggy rolled smoothly over the ground.</p>

<p>They passed through the little square in front of Hill's
grocery, and as luck would have it, Professor Strout was
<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>standing on the platform smoking a cigar. Huldy smiled
and nodded to him, and Quincy, with true politeness, followed
a city custom and raised his hat, but the Professor
did not return the bow, nor the salute, but turning on his
heel walked into the grocery store.</p>

<p>"Professor Strout is not very polite, is he, Mr. Sawyer?"
asked Huldy, laughing.</p>

<p>Quincy replied, looking straight ahead, "He has never
learned the first letter in the alphabet of the art."</p>

<p>Quincy had a disagreeable duty to perform. He enjoyed
Miss Huldy's company, but she was not the sort of girl he
could love enough to make his wife. Then the thought
came to him, supposing she should fall in love with him;
that was not impossible, and it must be prevented.</p>

<p>When they were about half a mile from Mason's Corner,
on their way home, Quincy realized that he could not put
the matter off any longer.</p>

<p>Just as he was going to speak to her she turned to him
and said, "Let me drive the rest of the way home, Mr.
Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Quincy, "I think I had better keep the
reins. You know I am responsible for you until you are
safe at home."</p>

<p>Huldy pouted. "You think I can't drive," said she, "I
have driven horses all my life. Please let me, Mr. Sawyer,"
she added coaxingly. And she took the reins from his
hands.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "you are now responsible for me
and I shall expect you to be very careful."</p>

<p>They drove a short distance in silence; then Quincy
turned to her and said abruptly, "This is our last ride together,
Miss Mason."</p>

<p>"Why?" inquired she with an astonished look in her face.</p>

<p>"I am going to leave your very pleasant home to-morrow,"
said Quincy.</p><p><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></p>

<p>The girl's cheeks paled perceptibly.</p>

<p>"Are you going back to Boston?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, not for some time," Quincy replied, "but I have
had some advice given me and I think it best to follow it."</p>

<p>"You have been advised to leave my father's house,"
said she, holding the reins listlessly in her hand.</p>

<p>Quincy said, "You won't be offended if I tell you the
whole truth?"</p>

<p>"No; why should I?" asked Huldy.</p>

<p>As she said this she gathered up the reins and gave them
a sharp pull. The white mare understood this to be a signal
to do some good travelling and she started off at a
brisk trot.</p>

<p>Quincy said, "I was told yesterday by a friend that if I
was not a marrying man they would advise me to leave
Deacon Mason's house at once."</p>

<p>The blood shot into Huldy's face at once. He was not a
marrying man and consequently he was going to leave.
He did not care for her or he would stay. Then another
thought struck her. Perhaps he was going away because
he was afraid she would fall in love with him.</p>

<p>As the Deacon had said, she was high spirited, and for an
instant she was filled with indignation. She shut her eyes,
and her heart seemed to stop its beating. She heard
Quincy's voice, "Look out for the curve, Miss Mason."
She dropped the left rein and mechanically gave the right
one a strong, sharp pull with both hands. Quincy grasped
the reins, but it was too late.</p>

<p>Huldy's pull on the right rein had thrown the horse
almost at right angles to the buggy. The steep hill and
sharp curve in the road did the rest. The buggy stood for
an instant on two wheels, then fell on its side with a crash,
taking the horse off her feet at the same time.</p>

<p>Huldy pitched forward as the buggy was falling, striking
her left arm upon the wheel, and then fell into the road.<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>
Quincy gave a quick leap over the dasher, falling on the
prostrate horse, and grasping her by the head, pressed it
to the ground. The mare lay motionless. Quincy rushed
to Miss Mason and lifted her to her feet, but found her a
dead weight in his arms. He looked in her face. She had
evidently fainted. Her left arm hung by her side in a helpless
sort of way; he touched it lightly between the elbow and
shoulder. It was broken. Grasping her in his arms he ran
to the back door and burst into the kitchen where Mrs.
Mason was at work.</p>

<p>Quincy said in quick, excited tones, "There has been an
accident, Mrs. Mason, and your daughter's arm is broken;
she has also fainted. I will take her right to her room and
put her on her bed. You can bring her out of that." Suiting
the action to the word, he took Huldy upstairs, saying,
"I will go for the doctor at once."</p>

<p>Then he dashed down the stairs and out of the front
door; as he reached the team he found Hiram standing
beside it, his eyes wide open with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Had a smash-up, Mr. Sawyer?" he asked. "How did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"All my carelessness," said Quincy. "Come, give me a
lift on the buggy, quick."</p>

<p>How it was done Quincy could never tell afterwards, but
in a very short time the buggy was righted, the mare on her
feet and the harness adjusted. Hiram took off his cap and
began dusting the mare, whose white coat showed the dust
very plainly.</p>

<p>"Where does the nearest doctor live, Hiram?" asked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Second house up the road you just come down," said
Hiram. "The folks say he don't know much, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, you get him here as quick as possible," said
Quincy. "I am going to Eastborough Centre to telegraph
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>for a surgeon and a trained nurse. Can you remember
that?"</p>

<p>Quincy passed him a dollar bill.</p>

<p>Hiram winked and said, "I guess I can," and darted off
up the hill.</p>

<p>Quincy sprang into the team and the white mare dashed
forward at full speed. As he reached the Pettengill house
he saw Ezekiel standing at the front gate. With difficulty
he pulled the mare up, for she was greatly excited.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pettengill," said he, "there has been a serious accident.
Miss Mason has been thrown from her carriage and
her left arm is broken. I sent Hiram for a doctor and I
am on my way to Eastborough to telegraph to Boston for
a surgeon and a nurse. I shall not return to-night. Go up
to the Deacon's and stay with her."</p>

<p>As he said this the mare gave a bound forward and she
never slackened pace until Eastborough Centre was
reached.</p>

<p>Quincy sent his telegram and returned the injured buggy
and the horse to the stable keeper, telling him to have it
repaired and he would pay the bill. He arranged to have
a driver and a four-seated team ready on the arrival of the
train bearing the doctor and the nurse. In about an hour
he received a telegram that they would leave on the 6.05
express and would reach Eastborough Centre at 7.15.</p>

<p>They arrived, and the hired driver, doctor, and nurse
started for Mason's Corner.</p>

<p>The last train to Boston left at 9.20. Ten minutes before
that hour the team returned with the doctor.</p>

<p>"She is all right," he said. "Everything has been done
for her, and the other doctor will write me when my services
are needed again. Good night."</p>

<p>The train dashed in and the doctor sped back to Boston.</p>

<p>Quincy had engaged a room at the hotel, and he at once
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>retired to it, but not to sleep. He passed the most uncomfortable
night that had ever come to him.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Hiram told Mandy that he heard
Professor Strout say to Robert Wood that he guessed that
"accident would never have occurred if that city chap
hadn't been trying to drive hoss with one hand."</p>

<p>Mandy said, "That Strout is a mean old thing, anyway,
and if you tell me another thing that he says, I'll fill your
mouth full o' soft soap, or my name isn't Mandy Skinner."</p><p><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></p>

<h3>SOME SAD TIDINGS.<br /></h3>

<p>The morning of the accident, when Quincy saw Ezekiel
Pettengill standing on the steps of Uncle Ike's house,
Ezekiel was the bearer of some sad tidings.</p>

<p>He recognized Quincy as the latter started to come up
the path, and saw him retrace his steps, and naturally
thought, as most men would, that the reason Quincy did
not come in was because he did not wish to meet him.</p>

<p>"Who was you looking after?" asked Uncle Ike, as Ezekiel
entered the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>"I think it was Mr. Sawyer," replied Ezekiel, "on his
way to Eastborough Centre."</p>

<p>"That Mr. Sawyer," said Uncle Ike, "is a very level-headed
young man. He called on me once and I like him
very much. Do you know him, 'Zeke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know who he is," Ezekiel answered, "but I have
never been introduced to him. He nods and I nod, or I
say, 'good mornin',' and he says, 'good mornin'.'"</p>

<p>"Don't you go up to Deacon Mason's as much as you
used to, 'Zeke?" asked Uncle Ike. "I thought Huldy and
you were going to make a match of it."</p>

<p>Ezekiel replied, "Well, to be honest, Uncle Ike, Huldy
and me had a little tiff, and I haven't seen her to speak to
her for more than three weeks, but I guess it will all come
out all right some day."</p>

<p>"Well, you're on the right track, 'Zeke," said Uncle Ike.
"Do all your fighting before you get married. But what
brings you down here so early in the morning?"</p><p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></p>

<p>"I've got some bad news," replied Ezekiel. "Have you
heard from Alice lately?"</p>

<p>"No," said Uncle Ike, "and I can't understand it. She
has always written to me once a fortnight, and it's a month
now since I heard from her, and she has sent me a book
every Christmas until this last one."</p>

<p>"She has been very sick, Uncle Ike," said Ezekiel. "She
was taken down about the middle of December and was
under the doctor's care for three weeks."</p>

<p>"Is she better?" asked Uncle Ike eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is up again," said Ezekiel, "but she is very
weak; but that ain't the worst of it," he added.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" asked Uncle Ike. "Why
didn't her friends let us know?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't let them," said Ezekiel. "If it hadn't
been for what the eye doctor told her she wouldn't have
telegraphed to me what she did."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with her?" cried Uncle Ike
almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle Ike," said Ezekiel, and the tears stood in
his eyes as he said it, "our Allie is almost blind, but the
eye doctor says she will get better, but it will take a very
long time. She has had to give up her job, and I am going
to Boston again to-morrow to bring her home to the old
house."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with her eyes?" asked Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"He called them cataracts," said Ezekiel, "or something
like that."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike sat down in his armchair and thought for a
minute or two.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "I know what they are; I have read all
about them, and I know people who have had them. One
was a schoolmate of mine. He was a mighty smart fellow
and I felt sorry for him and used to help him out in his
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>studies. I heard he had his eyes operated on and recovered
his sight."</p>

<p>"Well, the doctor she has," said Ezekiel, "is agin operations.
He says they can be cured without them. She
drops something in her eyes and blows something in them,
and then the tears come, and then she sits quietly with her
hands folded, thinking, I suppose, till the time comes to
use the medicine again."</p>

<p>"What can I do to help you?" asked Uncle Ike. "You
know I always loved Alice even better than I did my own
children, because she is more lovable, I suppose. Now,
'Zeke, if you want any money for doctor's bills or anything
else, I am ready to do everything in the world I can for
Alice. Did she ask after me, 'Zeke?"</p>

<p>"Almost the first thing she said was, 'How is dear old
Uncle Ike?' and then she said how glad she would be to get
back to Eastborough, where she could have you to talk to.
'I am lonesome now,' she said, 'I cannot write nor read, and
the time passes so slowly with no one to talk to.'"</p>

<p>"But the poor dear girl can't walk down here to see me,"
said Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"That's just what I came to see you about," said Ezekiel.
"The greatest favor you can do Alice and me is to come up
to the old house and live with us for a while and be company
for Alice. You can have the big front room that
father and mother used to have, and Alice's room, you
know, is just side of that. In a little while I shall have to
be busy on the farm and poor Alice&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk any more about it, 'Zeke," said Uncle Ike.
"Of course I'll come. She will do me as much good as I'll
do her. Send down the boys with the team to-morrow
noon and I'll be all settled by the time you get back."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said Ezekiel. "It is very good of you. Uncle
Ike, to give up your little home here that you like so much
and come to live with us. I know you wouldn't do it for
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>anybody but Alice, and I'll leave her to thank you when
she gets down here."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike and Ezekiel shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>"Don't you need any money, 'Zeke?" asked Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ezekiel. "Alice wouldn't let me pay out
a cent; she had some money saved up in the bank and she
insisted on paying for everything herself. She wouldn't
come home till I promised 'her I'd let her pay her board
when she got able to work again."</p>

<p>"She always was independent," said Uncle Ike, "and that
was one reason why I liked her. But more than that, she
is the fairest-minded and best-tempered woman I ever met
in my life, and I have seen a good many."</p>

<p>Ezekiel shook hands again with Uncle Ike, and then
started off briskly with a much lighter heart than he had
before the interview. Reaching home he astonished Mandy
Skinner by telling her that he was going to bring his sister
down from Boston and that Uncle Ike was coming to live
with them for a while.</p>

<p>"My Lord!" cried Mandy, "and do you expect me to do
all this extra work?"</p>

<p>"I don't expect nothing," said Ezekiel. "You can get
old Mrs. Crowley to come and do the heavy work, and I
guess you can get along. You allus said you liked her, she
was such a nice washer and ironer. She can have the little
room over the ell, and I'll give you a dollar a week extra for
your trouble. Do you think you can get along, Mandy?"</p>

<p>Mandy answered, "I know I can with your sister all
right, but if your Uncle Ike comes out here in the kitchen
and tells me how to roast meat and make pies, as he did
once, there will be trouble, and he may have to do all the
cooking."</p>

<p>Ezekiel smiled, but said nothing, and went off upstairs to
look at the two rooms that were to be occupied by Uncle
Ike and poor Allie.</p><p><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></p>

<h3>LOOKING FOR A BOARDING PLACE.<br /></h3>

<p>When Quincy awoke in his room at the hotel on the
morning after the accident he found to his great
surprise that it was nine o'clock. He arose and dressed
quickly, and after a light breakfast started off towards
Uncle Ike's. Reaching the house he was astonished at the
sight that met his gaze. Everything was out of place. The
bed was down and the bedding tied up in bundles; the books
had been taken from the bookcase and had been piled up on
the table. There was no fire in the stove, and the funnel
was laid upon the top of it. Quincy had remembered that
he had seen a pile of soot on the ground near the steps as he
came up them. All of Uncle Ike's cooking utensils were
packed in a soap box which stood near the stove.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Pettengill, are you going to
move?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"For a time at least," replied Uncle Ike. "'Zeke Pettengill's
sister has been struck blind and he is going to bring
her down home this afternoon and I am going to live with
them and be company for her. I always thought as much
of Alice as if she was my own daughter, and now she is in
trouble, her old uncle isn't going back on her. It isn't Ike
Pettengill's way."</p>

<p>"Have you seen 'Zekiel Pettengill this morning?" asked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"No, nor I didn't expect to," replied Uncle Ike. "I suppose
he went to Boston on the nine o'clock train and will
be back on the three o'clock express."</p><p><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></p>

<p>"Mr. Pettengill," said Quincy, "can you give me fifteen
minutes' time for a talk?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Ike, looking at his watch, "it will be
half an hour before Cobb's twins will be down here with
the team, and I might as well listen to you as sit around and
do nothing. They are coming down again by and by to
get the chickens. I have a good mind to set the house on
fire and burn it up. If I don't, I suppose some tramp will,
and if I need another house like it, thank the Lord I've got
money enough to build it."</p>

<p>"No, don't burn it up, Mr. Pettengill," said Quincy.
"Let it to me. I am around looking for a boarding place
myself."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, what made you leave Deacon
Mason's?"</p>

<p>"That's what I want to tell you," said Quincy. "Time is
limited and I'll make my story short, but you are a friend
of my father's, and I want you to understand the whole
business."</p>

<p>"Why, what have you been up to?" asked Uncle Ike,
opening his eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Quincy, "and that's the trouble. When
I went to Deacon Mason's nobody told me that his daughter
was engaged to Ezekiel Pettengill."</p>

<p>"And she isn't," interjected Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "they have been keeping company
together, but I didn't know it. Miss Mason is a pretty girl
and a very pleasant one. Time hung heavily on my hands
and I naturally paid her some attentions; gave her flowers
and candy, and took her out to ride, but I never thought of
falling in love with her, and I am not conceited enough to
think she is in love with me."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Uncle Ike reflectively. "Perhaps
she has heard your father was worth a million dollars."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe that," said Quincy. "Miss Mason
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>is too true and honest a girl to marry a man simply for his
money."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you are right there," remarked Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"New Year's night," said Quincy, "at the concert in the
Town Hall, Strout, the singing teacher, got down on me because
Miss Putnam and I received so much applause for
singing a duet together. Then I broke his heart by whistling
a tune for the girls and boys, and then again he doesn't
like me because I am from the city! he hired a fellow to
whip me, but the fellow didn't know how to box and I
knocked him out very quickly. Now that Strout can't hurt
me any other way he has gone to work making up lies, and
the village is full of gossip about Miss Mason and me.
Deacon Mason was going to talk to me about it, but I told
him yesterday morning that I was going to get another
boarding place, and I should have done so yesterday but
for a very unfortunate accident."</p>

<p>"Accident?" said Uncle Ike; "why, you seem to be all
right."</p>

<p>"I wish I had been the victim," said Quincy, "instead of
Miss Mason. I took her out riding yesterday and the
buggy got tipped over right in front of Deacon Mason's
house, and Miss Mason had her left arm broken above the
elbow. I have done all I could to atone for my carelessness,
but I am afraid 'Zeke Pettengill will never forgive me.
I wish, Mr. Pettengill, you would make him understand my
position in the matter. I would like to be good friends with
him, for I have nothing against him. He is the most gentlemanly
young man that I have seen in the town. I value
his good opinion and I want him to understand that I
haven't intentionally done anything to wrong or injure
him."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike covered his eyes with his hands and mused for
a few minutes; then he finally said, "Mr. Sawyer, I have
got an idea. That fellow, Strout, thinks he runs this town,
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>and it would tickle him to death if he thought he made
things uncomfortable for you. Then, again, I happen to
know that he is sweet on Huldy Mason himself, and he
would do all he could to widen the breach between 'Zeke
and her. You see, he isn't but forty himself, and he
wouldn't mind the difference in ages at all. Now, my plan
is this." Uncle Ike looked out the window and said, "Here
comes Cobb's twins with the team. Now we will take, my
things up to the house, then you take the team and go up
to Deacon Mason's and get your trunk and bring it down
to Pettengill's house. You will be my guest for to-night,
anyway, and if I don't make things right with 'Zeke so you
can stay there, I'll fix it anyway so you can stay till you get
a place to suit you. Now don't say no, Mr. Sawyer. Your
father and I are old friends and he will sort o' hold me
responsible for your good treatment. I won't take no for
an answer. If you have no objections, Mr. Sawyer, I wish
you would keep your eye on those books when they are
put into the team, for those Cobb boys handle everything
as though it was a rock or a tree stump." And Uncle Ike,
taking his kerosene lamp in one hand and his looking
glass in the other, cried, "Come in," as one of the Cobb
boys knocked on the door.</p><p><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>A VISIT TO THE VICTIM.<br /></h3>

<p>It was not until Quincy had reached the Pettengill house
and helped Uncle Ike get his things in order, that he
finally decided to accept Uncle Ike's offer. If he went to
Eastborough Centre to live at the hotel, he knew Strout
would consider he had won a victory. He had thought of
going to Mr. and Mrs. Putnam about a room and board,
but then he remembered Lindy, and said to himself that
Miss Putnam was a pretty girl and it would be the same old
story over again. Then he thought, "There won't be any
danger here with a blind girl and Mandy Skinner, and if
Uncle Ike can arrange matters it will be the best thing I
can do."</p>

<p>And so he drove up to Deacon Mason's with Cobb's
twins, saw Mrs. Mason, went upstairs and packed his trunk
quickly, and the Cobb boys drove away with it to his new,
though perhaps only temporary, lodgings.</p>

<p>When Quincy went downstairs, Mrs. Mason was in the
parlor, and she beckoned to him to come in. He entered
and closed the door.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you a few minutes," said she, "and I
want to tell you first I don't blame you a bit. I know you
told 'Zeke Pettengill that the tip-over was all your carelessness,
but Huldy says it ain't so. She said she was driving,
though you didn't want her to, and the accident was all her
fault. Now, I believe my daughter tells the truth, and the
Deacon thinks so too."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Mason," said Quincy, "what your daughter
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>says is partly true, but I am still to blame for allowing her
to drive a horse with which she was not acquainted."</p>

<p>"That warn't the trouble, Mr. Sawyer," said Mrs. Mason.
"Huldy told me the whole truth. You said something to
her about going away. She had heard what the village
gossips were saying. Huldy's got a high temper and she
was so mad that she got flustrated, and that's what caused
all the trouble. I like you, Mr. Sawyer, and Huldy likes
you. She says you have allus been a perfect gentleman,
and the Deacon now is awful sorry you are going, but I
hope you will come and see us often while you stay at
Mason's Corner."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall, Mrs. Mason," replied Quincy. "How
is Miss Mason?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she is fust rate," said the Deacon's wife. "That
doctor from the city fixed her arm all up in what he called
a jacket, and that nurse that you sent just seems to know
what Huldy wants before she can ask for it I hear them
nurses are awful expensive, and I don't think she better
stay but a day or two longer."</p>

<p>"She can't leave till the surgeon comes from Boston and
says she can go," he remarked, thinking this was the easiest
way to get out of it. "May I see Miss Mason?" he added.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Mrs. Mason. "She is in the front
chamber. We moved her in there 'cause there is a fireplace
in the room and the nurse objected to the wood stove that
Huldy had in her room. She said it was either too hot or
too cold, and that Huldy must have an even temperature."</p>

<p>As Quincy entered the room Huldy looked up and a
faint smile lighted her face. Her usually rosy cheeks
showed only a faint touch of pink. The helpless left arm,
in its plaster of paris jacket, rested on the outside of the
white quilt, the fingers on her little hand projecting beyond
the covering.</p>

<p>Quincy advanced to the bedside and took a vacant chair.<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>
The nurse was sitting by the window. She glanced up at
him and at Mrs. Mason, who followed close behind him,
but continued the reading of her book.</p>

<p>Quincy said lightly, as he reached over and took the
right hand and gave it a little shake, "You're not shaking
hands with the left, Miss Mason."</p>

<p>"No," said Huldy, "I wish I could shake it, but nurse
says it will have to stay on for two or three weeks, and it is
so heavy, Mr. Sawyer."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason went to the nurse and whispered to her,
"Don't let him stay too long." The nurse nodded and Mrs.
Mason left the room.</p>

<p>Quincy said in a low tone, as he sat in the chair by the
bedside, "Miss Mason, I can't express my sorrow for this
unfortunate occurrence. Your mother says you have told
her it was your fault. But I insisted it was my fault in
allowing you to drive a strange horse."</p>

<p>Huldy smiled. "It wasn't the horse, Mr. Sawyer," she
said, and quickly changing the subject asked, "Where are
you going to board now?".</p>

<p>"Old Uncle Ike Pettengill has taken pity on me," replied
Quincy, thinking he would not say anything about going
to Ezekiel Pettengill's house.</p>

<p>"But," said Huldy, "Zekiel called here this morning
before he went to Boston for his sister and told me that
Uncle Ike was coming to live with him. Didn't I hear
them take your trunk away a little while ago?"</p>

<p>Quincy saw it was useless to prevaricate, so he said, "My
trunk was taken to Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill's house."</p>

<p>"I hope you and 'Zekiel will be good friends," said
Huldy, with a grave look on her face.</p>

<p>"I trust we may become so," remarked Quincy. "I am
afraid we are not now, and I am still more afraid it is my
fault that we are not on the best of terms."</p>

<p>Huldy turned her face towards him, a red flush coloring
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>her cheeks and brow. "No," she said, with vehemence,
"it was my fault, and you know it, Mr. Sawyer. How you
must hate me for having caused you so much trouble."
She gave a convulsive sob and burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>Quincy was on the point of assuring Huldy that he could
never hate her and that they would always be good
friends, but he had no opportunity to frame the words.</p>

<p>As Huldy sobbed and began to cry, the nurse jumped to
her feet, dropped her book on the floor, and came quickly
to the bedside. She said nothing, but the look upon her
face convinced Quincy that he must wait for a more auspicious
moment to declare his friendly sentiment. So
with a "Good-by, Miss Mason, I'll call again soon," he
quitted the apartment and left the victim to the ministrations

<h3>A QUIET EVENING.<br /></h3>

<p>After the somewhat exciting termination of his interview
with Miss Mason, Quincy left the house quickly
and walked down to Ezekiel Pettengill's. Uncle Ike was
there and he told Mandy to show Mr. Sawyer to his room,
which proved to be the big front one upstairs.</p>

<p>When he was alone, Quincy sank into the capacious
rocking chair and fell to thinking. His mind went back to
his parting with Miss Mason. She had said that it wasn't
the horse, so it must have been what he said to her. Was
she angry because he had decided to go in order to stop
village gossip, or had she really cared for him? Well, it
was over now. He would never know what her real feelings
were, and after all it was best for him not to know.
He would drop the whole matter where it was. Then he
began to think about his present position. Here he was
located in the house of the man who would naturally be
considered the last one to desire his company.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike had told him that he would make it all right.
If he failed in this and Ezekiel objected to his remaining
he could move again. He was determined not to leave
Mason's Corner till he got ready, and he felt sure he would
not be ready to go until he had squared accounts with
Strout.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the sound of wheels. The Pettengill
house faced the south and Eastborough Centre lay west of
Mason's Corner, so he could not see the team when it
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>arrived, as it drove up to the back door, but he knew that
Ezekiel had arrived with his sister. Uncle Ike and Cobb's
twins went down stairs quickly; there was a jumble of
voices, and then the party entered the house. A short time
after he heard persons moving in the room adjoining his,
and guessed that Ezekiel's sister was to occupy it.</p>

<p>Then he fell to imagining the conversation that was
doubtless going on between Uncle Ike and his nephew.
Quincy was not naturally nervous, but he did not like suspense;
almost unconsciously he arose and walked back and
forth across the room several times. Then it occurred to
him that probably the uncle and nephew were having their
conversation in the parlor, which was right under him, and
he curbed his impatience and threw himself into the armchair,
which stood near the open fireplace.</p>

<p>As he did so there came a sharp rap at the door. In
response to the quick uttered "Come in," the door opened
and Uncle Ike entered. He came forward, took a seat in
the rocking chair near Quincy and passed him two letters.</p>

<p>Quincy looked up inquiringly. He had had his mail
sent to Eastborough Centre, where he had hired a box.
At the Mason's Corner post office the letters were stuck
upon a rack, where every one could see them, and Quincy
did not care to have the loungers at Hill's grocery inspecting
his correspondence.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike saw the look and understood it. Then he
said, "'Zekiel brought these over from Eastborough Centre.
He didn't want to, but the postmaster said one of
them was marked 'In haste,' and he had been over to the
hotel and found that you had gone to Mason's Corner, and
probably wouldn't be back to-day, and so he thought
'Zekiel better bring it over."</p>

<p>"It was very kind of Mr. Pettengill," said Quincy, "and
I wish you would thank him for me."</p>

<p>In the meantime he had glanced at his letters. One
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>bore, printed in the corner, the names, Sawyer, Crowninshield,
&amp; Lawrence, Counsellors at Law, Court Street, Boston,
Mass. That was from his father. The other was
directed in a feminine hand and bore the postmark, Mason's
Corner, Mass. He could not imagine from whom it could
be.</p>

<p>"I have had a talk with 'Zekiel," said Uncle Ike, "and
the whole matter is satisfactorily arranged; he is a fair-minded
young fellow and he don't believe you have done
anything with the intention of injuring him. What did
you pay up to Deacon Mason's?"</p>

<p>"Five dollars a week," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, it will be the same here," said Uncle Ike. "You
can stay as long as you like. 'Zeke wouldn't charge you
anything, but I said no, you have got to look out for your
sister, and Mr. Sawyer can afford to pay."</p>

<p>Quincy broke in, "And I wouldn't stay unless I did pay.
I am able and willing to pay more, if he will take it."</p>

<p>"Not a cent more," said Uncle Ike. "He will give you
your money's worth, and then one won't owe the other
anything. When you come down to supper I'll introduce
you, just as if you had never seen each other, and you can
both take a fresh start."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike arose. "By the time you have read your letters
supper will be ready, and I want to go in and have a
talk with Alice. She is my only niece, Mr. Sawyer, and I
think she is the finest girl in Massachusetts, and, as far
as I know, there ain't any better one in the whole world;"
and Uncle Ike went out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Quincy resumed his seat by the window. The light had
faded considerably, but he could still see to read. Naturally
enough he first opened the letter bearing the feminine
handwriting. He looked at the signature first of all
and read "Lucinda Putnam." "What can she have to write
to me about?" he thought. He read the letter:</p><p><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></p>

<p class="right1">Mason's Corner, January 22, 186&mdash;</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Sawyer:&mdash;I regret very much that I was
absent when you called, but am glad to learn from mother
that you had a pleasant visit. Although you are from the
city I am sure you would blush if you could hear the nice
things mother said about you. I am conceited enough to
think that you will find time to call on us again soon, for
I wish to consult you regarding an important business
matter. I am going to Boston next Monday in relation to
this business and if you could make it convenient to call
before then it would be greatly appreciated by</p>

<p class="right3">
Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Lucinda Putnam</span>.
</p>

<p>Quincy reflected. "What is she up to? Some legal business,
I suppose. Well, I am not practising law now; I
shall have to refer her to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took up the other letter and read, "Sawyer, Crowninshield,
&amp; Lawrence."</p>

<p>His father's letter read as follows:</p>

<p class="right1">Boston, January 21, 186&mdash;</p>

<p>My dear Son:&mdash;Yours at hand, and inquiries carefully
noted. I had a brother, James Edward Sawyer; he was
five years older than I and must be about sixty. Father
wished him to study law, but he wouldn't study anything.
When father died he got his share of the money, about
$50,000, but he squandered the most of it in high living.
The next we heard of him he had married a country girl
named Eunice Raymond, I think. He brought her to
Boston and tried to introduce her into the society he had
been brought up in. She was a nice, pretty woman, but
uneducated, and naturally bashful, and James finally left
the city and went to live somewhere in the country, I never
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>knew where! he never wrote me after leaving Boston. This
Jim Sawyer may be your uncle. I hope not, but if he is,
remember he is my brother, and if he needs any assistance
let me know at once. I hope your health is improving.
Your mother and sisters are well and send love, as does also</p>

<p class="right7">
Your affectionate father,</p>
<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Nathaniel Adams Sawyer</span>.
</p>

<p>As Quincy finished his second letter there was another
rap at the door and Mandy's voice was heard outside
saying, "Supper's ready, Mr. Saw&mdash;yer."</p>

<p>Quincy jumped to his feet. He had not unlocked his
trunk, as he was not certain that it would be worth while
to do so. It was but the work of a few moments to make
the necessary changes in his toilet. He put on a black
Prince Albert coat in place of a sack coat that he usually
wore, but before he had completed this change there came
another tap on the door, and Mandy's voice was heard
saying, "The things will get cold if you don't come down
right away."</p>

<p>As Quincy entered the large room which was used for a
dining-room, he was met by Uncle Ike. Ezekiel was standing
a short distance from his uncle. Uncle Ike said,
"'Zekiel, this is my friend, Mr. Sawyer. Mr. Sawyer, this
is my nephew, 'Zekiel Pettengill. I am good friends with
both of you, and I hope you will be good friends to each
other."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands. If each had any idea of what
the other was thinking about he did not betray it by look
or act.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike continued, "Mr. Sawyer, this is Jim Cobb and
this is Bill Cobb, and this," as Mandy entered bearing
something for the table, "is Miss Mandy Skinner. Now
that we are all acquainted, I think we had all better introduce
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>ourselves at once to the supper. I haven't done such
a hard day's work for sixteen years."</p>

<p>Ezekiel insisted upon Uncle Ike taking the head of the
table. He motioned Mr. Sawyer to take the second seat
from his uncle on the right, while he took the first seat on
the left, with Cobb's twins next to him.</p>

<p>Quincy immediately surmised that when the sister
appeared at the table she would probably sit between him
and Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>The meal was not a very lively one as far as conversation
went. Quincy inquired politely concerning Miss Pettengill's
health, and Uncle Ike said she was tired after her
trip, and Mandy was going to take her supper up to her.</p>

<p>The meal was plentiful and well cooked. Quincy thought
to himself, how much brighter it would have looked, and
how much better the food would have tasted if Miss Huldy
Mason had been present with her pretty face, joyous laugh,
and occasional bright sayings.</p>

<p>After supper the things were quickly taken out by
Mandy. The white tablecloth was removed, and one in
which the prevailing color was bright red took its place.</p>

<p>The three men drew up to the open fireplace. Uncle
Ike pulled out his pipe and said, "Do you allow smoking
here, 'Zeke?"</p>

<p>'Zekiel replied, "I wish you and Mr. Sawyer to make
yourselves perfectly at home and do just as you would if
you were in your own house."</p>

<p>"Well, if I did that," said Uncle Ike, "you wouldn't need
Mandy, for I should be chief cook and bottle washer
myself."</p>

<p>Uncle Ike lighted his pipe, and Ezekiel took a cigar from
his pocket, saying, "I guess I'll smoke, too." Then his face
reddened. He said, "Beg pardon, Mr. Sawyer, I have only
this one."</p>

<p>"That's all right," rejoined Quincy, "a cigar would be
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>too heavy for me to-night. I have a slight headache, and
if you will excuse me I will roll a cigarette."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="image4" id="image4" href="images/image4.png">

  </a>
  <p class="caption">"Mandy Skinner," As She Appears In The Play.</p>
</div>

<p>He took his little case of rice paper from his pocket and
also a small pouch of tobacco, and deftly made and lighted
a cigarette. The three men sat smoking, and as Quincy
blew a ring into the air he wondered what Sir Walter
Raleigh would have said if he could have looked in upon
them.</p>

<p>Quincy broke the silence. "I am afraid, Uncle Ike, that
I have caused you much inconvenience by driving you out
of that pleasant front room where I found my trunk."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," replied Uncle Ike. "I hate carpets, and I
prefer to sleep in my own bed, and what's more, I wanted
to put up my stove, and there was no chance in that front
room. When real cold weather comes I always have a ton
of coal for my stove, so I am much better off where I am
than I would be downstairs. By the way, 'Zeke, just tell
me all about Alice again. You won't mind Mr. Sawyer; he
is one of the family now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Ezekiel, "Alice was taken sick about the
middle of December. The folks where she boarded sent
for a doctor. It was about eight o'clock in the morning
when she was taken, and it was noon before she got easy,
so they could get her to bed. She thought she was getting
better; then, she had another attack; then she thought
she was getting better again, and the third attack was the
worst of the three. The folks wanted to write to me, but she
wouldn't let them. When she really did begin to get better,
she found out there was something that was worse than
being sick. She found she couldn't see to read either print
or writing, but Alice is a spunky girl, and she wouldn't
give in, even then. A friend told her to go and see Dr.
Moses, who was an eye doctor, and put herself right under
his treatment. She thought she was going to get well right
off at first, but when she found it was likely to be a long
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>job, then she gave in and wrote to me. She has brought
her treatment down with her, and the doctor says she will
have to go to Boston once a month to see him, as he is too
busy to come down here."</p>

<p>At this point in the proceedings the door opened and
Mandy entered, bringing a large dish of big red apples and
another full of cracked shellbarks. She left the room and
returned almost immediately with a large dish full of popcorn.</p>

<p>"Have an apple?" said Ezekiel. "Help yourselves; we
don't pass anything round here. We put the things on the
table and each one helps himself."</p>

<p>Mandy came in again, bringing a large pitcher of cider
and some glasses, which she placed upon the table.</p>

<p>While the three men were discussing their country evening
lunch in silence, an animated conversation was taking
place in the kitchen, the participants being Mandy, Mrs.
Bridget Crowley, and Hiram, who always dropped in during
the evening to get his glass of cider, a luxury that was
not dispensed at Deacon Mason's.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mandy, "I think it's wasteful extravagance
for you Irish folks to spend so much money on carriages
when one of your friends happens to die. As you just said,
when you lived in Boston you own up you spent fourteen
dollars in one month going to funerals, and you paid a
dollar a seat each time."</p>

<p>"I did that," said Mrs. Crowley, "and I earned every bit
of it doing washing, for Pat, bless his sowl, was out of
work at the time."</p>

<p>"Just think of that!" said Mandy, turning to Hiram.</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be helped," said Mrs. Crowley, obstinately.
"Shure and if I don't go to folks' funerals they won't come
to mine."</p>

<p>This was too much for Mandy and Hiram, and they
began laughing, which so incensed Mrs. Crowley that she<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>trudged off to her little room in the ell, which departure
just suited Mandy and Hiram.</p>

<p>"Have you got any soft soap here in the kitchen?" asked
Hiram.</p>

<p>"No," said Mandy, "I used the last this afternoon. I shall
have to go out in the shed to-morrow morning and get
some."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be likely to go out to-night for any?"
asked Hiram.</p>

<p>"I guess not," said Mandy. "Why, there is rats out in
that shed as big as kittens. Did you want to use some?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hiram, "but I didn't want you to have any
'round handy, for I am bound to tell you I heard Strout
telling the minister's son that Lindy Putnam writ a letter
to Mr. Sawyer and mailed it at Mason's Corner post office
this mornin', and it was directed to Eastborough Centre,
and Strout said it looked as though they were keeping up
correspondence. I tell you that made 'Manuel Howe mad,
for he's gone on Lindy Putnam himself, and then Strout
said that probably all the fellers in town would have to
put off getting married until that city chap had decided
which one of the girls he wanted himself. And now, hang
it," said Hiram, "he has come to live in this house, and I
sha'n't have any peace of mind."</p>

<p>Hiram dodged the first apple Mandy threw at his head,
but the second one hit him squarely, and he gave a loud
"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Stop your noise," said Mandy, "or Mr. Pettengill will
be out here. I'll ask them if they want anything else," as
she rapped on the door. There was no response and she
opened it and looked in. "Why, they have all gone to bed,"
she said. At that moment the old clock in the kitchen
struck nine. "It's nine o'clock and you had better be going
home, Hiram Maxwell."</p>

<p>"I shall have to get some anarchy to put on my forehead,"<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>
said Hiram. "See that big bump, Mandy, that you
made."</p>

<p>Mandy approached him quite closely and looked at his
forehead; as she did so she turned up her nose and puckered
her mouth. Her arms were hanging by her side.
Hiram grasped her around the waist, holding both of her
arms tight, and before Mandy could break away he gave
her a kiss full on the mouth.</p>

<p>He made a quick rush for the door, opened it and dashed
out into the night. Luckily for him there was no moon
and he was out of sight before Mandy could recover her
self-possession and reach the door. She peered out into
the darkness for a moment; then she closed the door and
bolted it, took a lamp and went up to her own room.
Standing in front of her looking glass, she turned up her
nose and puckered up her mouth as she had done when
facing Hiram.</p>

<p>"That's the first time Hiram Maxwell ever kissed me,"
she said to herself, "Mebbe it will be the last time and
mebbe it won't." Then she said reflectively, "I didn't
think the little fellow had so much spunk in him."</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour she was dreaming of cupids, and
hearts, and arrows, and St. Valentine's Day, which was not
so very far away.</p><p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></p>

<h3>A LONG LOST RELATIVE.<br /></h3>

<p>Ezekiel Pettengill owned what Deacon Mason
did not&mdash;a nice carryall and a good road horse.
Ezekiel would fix no price, but Quincy would not drive
him unless he paid for the use of the team. One dollar for
half a day, two dollars for a whole day, were the prices
finally fixed upon.</p>

<p>Quincy drove first to Mrs. Putnam's. As he was ascending
the steps the front door was opened and Lindy stood
there to welcome him, which she did by extending her
hand and then showing him into the parlor. She was evidently
on the point of going out, for she had on her outdoor
garments. After a few commonplaces relating to health
and the weather, Quincy abruptly approached the object
of his visit by saying, "I received your letter, Miss Putnam,
and I have come to see if I can be of any service to you."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know you can," said Lindy; "you are wealthy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," interposed Quincy, "I am not what
they call a wealthy young man; the fact that my father is
possessed of a large fortune has probably given rise to
the incorrect impression just repeated by you."</p>

<p>"I understand," said Lindy, with a laugh. "What I
meant to say was, that you are undoubtedly acquainted
with wealthy gentlemen, who know the best ways of investing
money. I find my money a great trouble to me," she
continued. "I had $25,000 invested in a first mortgage,
but the property has been sold and the money repaid to me,
and I don't know what to do with it."</p><p><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></p>

<p>"The obvious thing to do," remarked Quincy, "is to
invest it at once, so that it will begin paying you interest."</p>

<p>"That is just what I wished to see you about," responded
Lindy. "How would you advise me to invest it?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I would not presume," replied Quincy, "to give positive
advice in such a case. I would go either to Foss &amp; Follansbee,
or Braithwaite &amp; Mellen, or perhaps Rothwell Brothers
&amp; Co., look over the securities they have for sale and
make my own selection, if I were in your place."</p>

<p>Lindy was manifestly disappointed at Quincy's polite
refusal to recommend any particular security, but she evidently
realized that further argument or entreaty would
be useless, so she quickly changed the subject by remarking
that her mother had considerable money invested, but that
she was a woman who never took any advice and never
gave any.</p>

<p>"I wonder who my mother is going to leave her money
to? Do you know, Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>Quincy replied that he did not. "But she did tell me
that by the terms of your brother's will you were not to
inherit it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you ever find out," said Lindy, "you will tell
me, won't you, Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "unless I am requested to keep it a
secret."</p>

<p>"But you wouldn't keep it from me, their own daughter,"
said Lindy.</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "I don't think it at all likely that they
will inform me; but I promise to tell you if I learn who it is
and am not bound in any way to keep the information
secret."</p>

<p>"And will you tell me just as soon as you know?" persisted
Lindy.</p>

<p>"In less than twenty-four hours from the time I learn
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>the name you shall hear it from my own lips," he replied.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lindy. "Would you like to see father
and mother? Father has been quite sick for a few days and
they are in their own room. I will go up and tell them you
are coming."</p>

<p>Quincy was left in the room. That gossip about Miss
Putnam could not be true. Gossip said she was ashamed
of her father and mother, and yet she had invited him to go
up and see them. What a pretty girl she was, well educated
and with a hundred thousand dollars; such a beautiful
singer and their voices blended so nicely together. How
pleased his mother and sisters would be if he should bring
home a wife like her. On the wall hung an oil portrait of
her, evidently painted within a short time. He sat looking
at it as Lindy opened the door.</p>

<p>Before he could remove his eyes from the picture, Lindy
had noticed his fixed gaze at it and smiled brightly.</p>

<p>"Mother would be delighted to see you."</p>

<p>Lindy rang a small bell that was on a table. In a moment
Samanthy entered the room.</p>

<p>"Samantha, please show Mr. Sawyer to mother's room.
Will you excuse me, Mr. Sawyer, if I am not here to say
good-by to you after you have seen mother? I am going
to the city this morning and there&mdash;" looking out of the
window&mdash;"here comes Abner Stiles; he is going to drive
me over to Eastborough. Did you ever meet Mr. Stiles,
Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I may have seen him," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Seeing him is nothing," said Lindy. "He must be
heard to be appreciated. He is a most engaging talker; he
has caught the biggest fish and killed the biggest bears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And told the biggest lies," broke in Quincy,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of any man in town," Lindy concluded.</p>

<p>"I think there is one man in town who can tell bigger
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>ones," Quincy said gravely; "he has been telling a good
many lately."</p>

<p>Lindy looked up and smiled. "He will never forgive
us for what we did at the concert," said she, "Well, I
mustn't keep Mr. Stiles waiting any longer, if I do he
may&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Try to compete with the other one," added Quincy.</p>

<p>She smiled again, and gave him her little gloved hand,
which he took in his for an instant.</p>

<p>She ran out quickly and got into the team, which immediately
drove off. Samanthy, who had been waiting impatiently
in the hallway, ushered Quincy into an upper
chamber, where sat Mrs. Putnam. Her husband was
reclining on a lounge near the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, I am awful glad to see yer," said Mrs. Putnam.
"Silas here hasn't been feelin' fust rate for more'n a week.
He's most frozen to death all the time. So I got him up
front of the fire, same as I used to roast turkeys. Set down,
Mr. Sawyer, and tell me all the news. Have you heerd
anybody going to git engaged or anybody going to git
married? I heerd as how you had left Deacon Mason's.
So you 'cided to take my advice. I'm kinder sorry you
tipped the buggy over, for Huldy Mason's a nice girl. The
fact is I was thinkin' more of her than I was of you, when
I told yer you'd better git out. Where be yer boardin'
now?"</p>

<p>"I am boarding at Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill's. His sister
has got home and his Uncle Isaac has come back to live
with him."</p>

<p>"Lord sakes, do tell!" said Mrs. Putnam. "I allus
thought that old fool would die out there in the woods and
they'd bury him in his chicken coop. But what on airth is
Alice home for? Has she lost her job?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy; "poor girl, she has almost lost
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>her sight. She has been very sick, and as a result she is
almost blind, and had to give up work and come home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam sank back in her chair.</p>

<p>"If I didn't think you were a truthful man, Mr. Sawyer,
I wouldn't b'lieve a word you said. My poor Alice. Why,
do you know, Mr. Sawyer, I never saw a human being in
all my life that I liked so much as I have Alice Pettengill.
Did you ever see her, Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"No," said Quincy, "she only arrived yesterday afternoon,
and she did not appear at supper nor at breakfast this
morning. She was tired and wished to rest, her brother
told me."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she won't die," said Mrs. Putnam. "I
have left her every dollar I've got in the world, and if she
should die I shouldn't know who on airth to give it to.
Well, there, I've let the cat out of the bag, and my daughter
Lindy, mean as she is about money, would give a thousand
dollars to know who I am goin' to leave my money
to. I wish I could see Alice. I can't walk, and that poor,
deaf girl can't see. Why, Mr. Sawyer, I think she's the
prettiest, sweetest girl I ever sot eyes on in my life, and
I've seed a good many on 'em. Now you tell me what you
think of her the next time you come up, won't you, Mr.
Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I certainly will," said Quincy, "and if she will come
with me I will bring her over to see you. If she came from
Boston with her brother, she can surely ride as far as this,"
he added.</p>

<p>"Tell her I shall count every minute till she, comes over
here, but don't say a word to her about my money," said
Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," Quincy answered. "You did not intend
to tell me."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," acknowledged Mrs. Putnam, "it slipped
out before I thought."</p><p><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></p>

<p>Quincy arose. "I must go now, Mrs. Putnam. I have
business at Eastborough Centre, and I don't know how
long it will take me, and besides, I am anxious to see Miss
Pettengill after your glowing description of her beauty
and her virtues."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't put the paint on half as thick as it
would stand," said Mrs. Putnam. "Well, good-by, Mr.
Sawyer. It's very kind in you to come and see two old
folks like us. No use saying good-by to Silas; he's stone
deef and besides he's sound asleep."</p>

<p>When Quincy took up the reins and started towards
Eastborough Centre it was with conflicting emotions. If
there had been no Alice Pettengill to see, his thoughts, no
doubt, would have related chiefly to Lindy Putnam, who
had never attracted his attention before as she had that
morning. Could Alice Pettengill be as pretty and as good
as Mrs. Putnam had portrayed? And she was to be an
heiress. He was sorry that Mrs. Putnam had told him.
When he was talking to Miss Pettengill what he knew
would be continually in his mind. He was glad that she
was to have the money, but very sorry that he knew she
was to have it; he had promised not to tell her, but he had
promised to tell Lindy. Mrs. Putnam had not told him
not to tell Lindy, but she had said Lindy would give a
thousand dollars to know. Now, was that the same as
requesting him not to tell Lindy, and should he tell Lindy
for nothing what her mother said she would give a thousand
dollars to know? Anyhow, that question must be
decided within the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Then he began to think of his intended visit to Eastborough
Poorhouse. Would the Jim Sawyer that he
found there turn out to be his own uncle? What a sweet
morsel that would be for Strout if it proved to be true.
Anyhow, he would follow his father's instructions and do
all he could for his uncle, come what might.</p><p><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></p>

<p>Since he had arrived at Mason's Corner everything that
he had done seemed to give rise to gossip, and a little more
of it could do no harm.</p>

<p>Quincy reached the Poorhouse and inquired for the
keeper. A very stout, red-faced man answered the summons.</p>

<p>He informed Quincy that his name was Asa Waters, and
that he had been keeper of the town Poorhouse for the
last ten years.</p>

<p>Quincy thought from his size, as he evidently weighed
between three and four hundred pounds, that he had probably
eaten all the food supplied for the inmates. In reply
to a direct question whether there was a man there by the
name of Jim Sawyer, Mr. Waters said "yes," but that he
was sick abed and had been for the last week.</p>

<p>"He coughs awful," said Waters; "in fact, I had to
change his room because the rest of us couldn't sleep.
When we tried to move him he became sort of crazy like,
and it took three on us to get him out of the room and take
him upstairs. He seems sot on getting back in that room.
The other day he crawled down stairs and we found him
trying to get into the room, but I had it locked and we had
another fight to get him upstairs again."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I would like to see him; it may
be he is a distant relative of our family. My father wishes
me to talk with him and make the inquiry anyway."</p>

<p>"What mought your name be?" asked Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>"My name is Quincy Adams Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember you," said Waters. "Wasn't you
the singer that Mr. Strout hired to come down from Boston
to sing at his concert. Strout told me he paid you $50
for singing that night, and by gosh it was worth it."</p>

<p>Quincy was not a profane young man, but he had to
smother an oath on hearing that. He replied, "Yes, I
sang that night."</p><p><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></p>

<p>"And," said Waters, "didn't you whistle that piece,
Listen to the Bobolink, fine?"</p>

<p>"Here, Sam," said he to a young fellow who appeared
in sight, "show this gentleman up to Jim Sawyer's room;
I'm getting kind of pussy, and I don't go upstairs much."</p>

<p>Sam performed his mission and Quincy was ushered into
the room and found himself with the sick man.</p>

<p>"Is your name James Sawyer?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man. "I used to be proud of it once."</p>

<p>"Did you have a brother?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jim, "I don't think he would be proud of
me now, so I guess I won't claim any relationship."</p>

<p>Quincy stopped for a moment. Evidently the man's
pride would keep him from telling anything about himself.
He would try him on a new tack. The man had a long fit
of coughing. When it had subsided, Quincy said, "It
wearies you to talk. I will do the talking, and if what I
say is true you can nod your head." Quincy continued,
"Your name is James Edward Sawyer, your brother's name
was Nathaniel." The man opened his eyes wide and looked
steadfastly at him. "Your father, Edward Sawyer, left
you fifty thousand dollars." The man clutched with both
hands at the quilt on the bed. "You are about sixty years
of age." The man nodded. "You married a young girl
who lived in the country and took her to Boston with you;
her maiden name was Eunice Raymond."</p>

<p>The man started up in bed, resting on his elbow. "How
did you know all this?" asked he. "Who has told you this?
Who are you?"</p>

<p>The exertion and the rapid speaking brought on another
fit of coughing and he fell back on his pillow.</p>

<p>"If what I have said is true," remarked Quincy quietly,
"your brother, Nathaniel, is my father, and I am your
nephew, Quincy Adams Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Who sent you to see me?" asked the man.</p><p><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></p>

<p>"I heard," replied Quincy, "that a man named James
Sawyer was in the Eastborough Poorhouse. I wrote to
my father, and in his reply he told me what I have just
said to you. If you are my uncle, father says to do everything
I can to help you, and if he had not said so I would
have done it anyway."</p>

<p>"It is all true," said the man faintly. "I squandered the
money my father left me. I married a sweet, young girl
and took her to the city. I tried to introduce her into the
set to which I once belonged. It was a failure. I was
angry, not with myself for expecting too much, but with
her because she gave me too little, as I then thought. We
had two children&mdash;a boy named Ray and a little girl named
Mary, after my mother."</p>

<p>"My grandmother," said Quincy.</p>

<p>James Sawyer continued: "I took to drink. I abused the
woman whose only fault had been that she had loved me. I
neglected to provide for my family. My wife fell sick, my
two little children died, and my wife soon followed them.
I returned from a debauch which had lasted me for about a
month to find that I was alone in the world. I fled from
the town where we had lived, came here and tried to reform.
I could not. I fell sick and they sent me here to the
Poorhouse. I have had no ambition to leave. I knew if
I did it would mean the same old life. I am glad you
came. I cannot tell you how glad. I do not wish for any
assistance; the town will care for me as long as I live, which
will not be very long; but your coming enables me to perform
an act of justice which otherwise I could not have
done."</p>

<p>"Tell me in what way I can serve you," said Quincy,
"and it shall be done."</p>

<p>"Look outside of the door," said the man, "and see if
anybody is listening."</p><p><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></p>

<p>Quincy opened the door suddenly and the broad face of
Mr. Asa Waters stood revealed.</p>

<p>"I thought I would come up and see if Mr. Sawyer
wanted anything."</p>

<p>"If he does," said Quincy, "I will inform you;" and he
closed the door in Mr. Waters's face.</p>

<p>Quincy waited till he heard his ponderous footsteps descending
the stairs at the foot of the hallway.</p>

<p>"Was old Waters out there listening?" asked Jim Sawyer.</p>

<p>"I don't think he had time to hear anything," Quincy
replied.</p>

<p>"Come closer," said Jim; "let me whisper. I am not
penniless. I have got some money. I have five thousand
dollars in government bonds. I sold some stock I owned
just before I went off on that last debauch, but I didn't
spend all the money. When I die I want you to pay back
to the town of Eastborough every dollar I owe for board.
Don't let anybody know you got the money from me. Pay
it yourself and keep the balance of it yourself."</p>

<p>"Where is the money?" said Quincy.</p>

<p>"It is down in my old room, No. 24, one flight down
from here, at the other end of the hallway. I have got a
key that will open the door. I made it myself. I nearly
got in there the other day, but they caught me before I
had a chance to open the door. If you can get in there take
up the fourth brick from the window, second row from the
front of the fireplace, and you will find the bonds in an old
leather wallet. What time is it?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Half-past eleven," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Now is your time," said the man; "all the hands have
their dinner from half-past eleven to twelve; at twelve they
feed us; take this key, and if you get the money, for God's
sake come around to-morrow and let me know. I sha'n't
sleep a wink till I hear from you."</p><p><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></p>

<p>Quincy pressed the sick man's hand and left the room.
He went downstairs on tiptoe and quickly reached room
No. 24. He listened; all was quiet; it took but an instant
to open the door, and, slipping quietly in, he locked it
after him. With some difficulty he found the wallet,
looked inside and saw five one thousand dollar United
States bonds. He put the wallet in his pocket, replaced the
brick, and listened at the door; all was quiet. He unlocked
it, slipped out, locked it, and was retracing his steps, when
he saw Sam coming upstairs at the other end of the hallway.</p>

<p>"I think I took the wrong turn," said Quincy. "I
thought I came up that way."</p>

<p>"No," said Sam; "that's the back way."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Quincy, as he ran lightly downstairs.
At the foot he met Mr. Waters.</p>

<p>"Well, is he any relative of yours?" asked Waters.</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," replied Quincy; "he has given me
some facts, and I am going to write to Boston, and when I
hear from there I will be able to answer your question. I
will come around in a few days, as soon as I hear from the
city."</p>

<p>Quincy jumped into his team and drove to Eastborough
Centre post office to see if there were any letters for him.</p>

<p>When he reached the post office he found a letter from
his father, informing him his mother and sisters were going
to New York for a two weeks' visit and would very much
like to see him if he would run up the next day.</p>

<p>Quincy's mind was made up instantly. He drove to the
hotel, left the team, with instructions to have it ready for
him when he came down on the express that reached Eastborough
Centre at 7.15 P.M., ran for the station and
caught on to the back platform of the last car as it sped on
its way to Boston.</p>

<p>Arriving there, he first took a hasty lunch, then hiring
a coupe by the hour, drove to his bank on State Street.<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>
Here he left the bonds with instructions to write to Eastborough
Centre the amount realized from them and passed
to the credit of his account.</p>

<p>His next trip was to his father's house on Beacon Street,
where he found his mother and sisters. They were overjoyed
to see him, and his younger sister declared that he
had grown better looking since he went away. She wanted
to know if he had fallen in love with a country girl. Quincy
replied that his heart was still free and if it wasn't for the
law he would have her for his wife, and no one else. Maude
laughed and slapped him.</p>

<p>He next rode to his father's office on Court Street. The
Hon. Nathaniel had just lunched at Parker's and was enjoying
a good cigar when his son came in.</p>

<p>Quincy told him that the Jim Sawyer at Eastborough
Poorhouse was unquestionably their missing relative.</p>

<p>"Poor Jim," said Nathaniel; "I ought to go and see him."</p>

<p>"No; I wouldn't," said Quincy, "it will do no good, and
his remorse is deep enough now without adding to it."</p>

<p>He then told his father about the money, and the latter
agreed that Jim's idea was right and Quincy had best use
the money as though it were his own.</p>

<p>"By the by," said his father, wheeling round in his office
chair, "that Miss Putnam from Eastborough is a very pretty
girl; don't you think so, Quincy?"</p>

<p>"Handsome is as handsome does," thought Quincy to
himself, but he only said, "Where did you see her?"</p>

<p>"She was in here to-day," replied his father. "She said
she had $25,000 to invest, and that you gave her the address
of some broker, but that she had forgotten it."</p>

<p>"Her statement is partially true," said Quincy, "but not
complete. I gave her three addresses, because I did not
wish to recommend any particular one. I wished her to
make her own choice."</p>

<p>"I was not so conservative," remarked his father. "I
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>advised her to go to Foss &amp; Follansbee and even suggested
that Quinnebaug Copper Company was one of the most
promising investments before the public to-day."</p>

<p>"Did she confide in you any farther," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied his father; "I gleaned she was worth
$100,000 and that her parents, who were very old people,
had nearly as much more. I remember her brother, J. Jones
Putnam. He was a 'plunger,' and a successful one. He
died suddenly of lung fever, I believe."</p>

<p>Quincy smiled.</p>

<p>"She seemed to be well educated," his father continued,
"and told me that you and she sang together at a concert."</p>

<p>"Did she tell you what her father's religion was?"
inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to admire this young lady, Quincy. I
thought she would be likely to be a great friend of yours.
You might do worse than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Quincy, "she is pretty, well educated,
musical, very tasteful in dress, and has money, but she can't
have me. But how did it end?" asked he; "how did you get
rid of her?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied his father, "as I said before, I thought
she must be a great friend of yours, and perhaps more, so I
went down to Foss &amp; Follansbee's with her; then we went
to Parker's to lunch, then I sent her to the station in a
coupe."</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged to you, father," said Quincy, "for
the kind attentions you paid her. I shall get the full credit
of them down in Eastborough; your name will not be mentioned;
only," said Quincy with a laugh, "if she is coming
to the city very often I think perhaps I had better come
back to Boston and look after mother's interests."</p>

<p>The Hon. Nathaniel was nettled by this and said sternly,
"I do not like that sort of pleasantry, Quincy."</p><p><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Quincy coolly, "and I hope there
will be no further occasion for it."</p>

<p>"How long do you intend to remain in Eastborough?"
asked his father.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Quincy. "I can't come home
while Uncle Jim is sick, of course. I will ask him if he
would like to see you, and if he says yes, I will telegraph
you. Well, good-by. I was up to the house and saw mother
and the girls. I am going up to the club to see if I can
meet some of the boys and have some dinner, and I shall
go down on the 6.05 express."</p>

<p>Quincy lighted a cigar, shook hands rather stiffly with
his father and left the office.</p>

<p>When Quincy reached the Pettengill house it was a little
after eight o'clock. Hiram came out to help him put up
the horse. "Anybody up?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Only Mandy and me," said Hiram. "Uncle Ike is up
in his attic, and 'Zeke is up talkin' to his sister, and Mandy
and me has been talkin' to each other; and, say, Mr. Sawyer,
did you meet Lindy Putnam up in Boston to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," said Quincy between his shut teeth.</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny," said Hiram; "I heard Abner Stiles
telling Strout as how Miss Putnam told him that Mr. Sawyer
had been to the banker's with her to invest her money,
and that Mr. Sawyer took her out to lunch and then rode
down to the station in a carriage and put her aboard the
train."</p>

<p>"There are a great many Mr. Sawyers in Boston, you
must remember, Hiram," remarked Quincy. "Anything
else, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"Well, not much more," replied Hiram; "but Strout said
that if you got Lindy and her money and then cajoled the
old couple into leavin' their money to you, that it would
be the best game of bunco that had ever been played in
Eastborough."</p><p><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></p>

<p>"Well, Strout ought to know what a good bunco game
is," said Quincy. "Have the horse ready by nine o'clock in
the morning if you can get over. Good night, Hiram," he
said.</p>

<p>He passed through the kitchen, saying good night to
Mandy, and went straight to his own room. He sat and
thought for an hour, going over the events of the day.</p>

<p>"As soon as Uncle Jim is dead and buried," said he to
himself, "I think I will leave this town. As the children say
when they play 'hide and go seek,' I am getting warm."</p><p><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></p>

<h3>A PROMISE KEPT.<br /></h3>

<p>Quincy was up next morning at eight o'clock and
ate his breakfast with 'Zekiel. 'Zekiel said his
sister did not sleep well nights, and so would not be down
till later.</p>

<p>"Do you want the team this morning, Mr. Pettengill?"
asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," said 'Zekiel, "but the Boston doctor wrote to Deacon
Mason that he was comin' down this afternoon to take
that stuff off Huldy's arm, and she wanted me to come
up, so I shall be up there all the afternoon."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Quincy. "Will you tell Deacon
Mason that I want the nurse to stay until to-morrow and
I will be up to see her at nine o'clock?"</p>

<p>Quincy took up the reins and started for Eastborough
Poorhouse.</p>

<p>He found his uncle weaker than on the day before.
Quincy touched his hand, but did not lift it from the bed.
Jim pointed towards the door.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Quincy, "there is no one there."</p>

<p>"Did you get it?" asked Uncle Jim in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Quincy, "and it's safe in the bank in
Boston."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Uncle Jim. "Now I don't care
how soon I am called to judgment for my sins."</p>

<p>"Uncle Jim," said Quincy, "I saw my father yesterday
afternoon. Would you like to have your brother come
see you?"</p><p><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></p>

<p>Uncle Jim shook his head. "It will do no good," said
he. "You have done all I could wish for. Pay the town
for my board. Give them what they ask. Do with the
balance what you wish, Quincy. It is yours."</p>

<p>"Where do you wish to be buried, Uncle?" asked Quincy
bravely.</p>

<p>"Right here," replied Uncle Jim. "One of the boys
here died about a month ago; his name was Tom Buck.
He was a good fellow and did many kind things for me.
Bury me side of him."</p>

<p>"One more question, Uncle," said Quincy. "In what
town did your wife and children reside when they died?"</p>

<p>"In Amesbury," said Uncle Jim. An idea seemed to
strike him. "Well, Quincy, do you suppose you could find
where they are buried?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can," Quincy answered.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Uncle Jim, "I don't deserve it, I am
not worthy of it, but she always loved me, and so did the
children. I never struck her, nor them, nor did I ever
speak unkindly to them. I never went home when I was
drunk. I deserted them and left them to suffer. I don't
think she would object, do you?"</p>

<p>Quincy divined his thoughts and answered, "No, I do
not, Uncle."</p>

<p>"If you will do it, Quincy," said Uncle Jim, "I shall die
a happy man. Buy a little lot and put me beside Eunice
and the children. Don't put my name on the stone, put
her name and those of the children. That will please me
best. She will know I am there, but others will not."</p>

<p>"It shall be done as you say, Uncle," said Quincy. "I
will be here early to-morrow morning and I shall come
every day to see you. Good-by."</p>

<p>He touched his uncle's hand again softly and left the
room. Uncle Jim, with a smile upon his wasted face, fell
asleep.</p><p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></p>

<p>Quincy drove leisurely towards Mason's Corner. It was
more than twenty-four hours since he had learned who
was to be Mrs. Putnam's heiress. He had made a promise.
Should he keep it? How could he avoid keeping it? He
would see Miss Putnam and be governed by circumstances.</p>

<p>He reached the Putnam house and was shown into the
same room as on the morning before. In a few minutes
Lindy joined him. He had never seen her looking better.
She had on a handsome gown that he had never seen before.
Quincy opened the conversation.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy your trip to Boston yesterday, Miss
Putnam?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Lindy, "I must tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>"There is no need to, Miss Putnam, I am acquainted
with the most important events of your trip already."</p>

<p>"Why, how?" asked Lindy. "Oh, I see," said she, "you
had a letter from your father."</p>

<p>"No," said Quincy. "I had the pleasure of a conversation
with my father yesterday afternoon in Boston."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" exclaimed Lindy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "but I might have learned all the
principal facts without leaving Mason's Corner. In fact, I
did learn them in a somewhat distorted shape late last evening."</p>

<p>Lindy colored until her forehead was as red as her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mr. Sawyer," she remarked.</p>

<p>"It is easily explained," said Quincy. "Mr. Stiles forgot
to mention that it was my father who was your escort
and not myself. Of course he would offer the similarity in
names as his excuse."</p>

<p>"And so," said Lindy, recovering herself, "you have
come here to scold me because Abner Stiles didn't tell the
truth. I told you he was a wonderful story teller."</p><p><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></p>

<p>"No, Miss Putnam," said Quincy, "I did not come here
for any such purpose. I made you a promise yesterday
and I have come to keep it. I know who is to inherit your
mother's money. She did not intend to tell me, but the
name escaped her unintentionally."</p>

<p>"Did she ask you not to tell me?" asked Lindy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy, "not in so many words."</p>

<p>"Then you must tell me," cried Lindy eagerly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Quincy. "Your mother said
you would give a thousand dollars to know the name of the
person. This fixes the condition on which I shall divulge
the name."</p>

<p>"And if I did give you a thousand dollars," inquired
Lindy, "what would you do with the money?"</p>

<p>"I should give it to your mother," said Quincy. "She
fixed the price of the secret, not I."</p>

<p>Lindy walked to the window and looked out. She
wished to know the name. She had her suspicions, but
she could not bear to give up a thousand dollars of her own
money, for she knew that this, too, would go to the unknown
heiress. She knew Alice Pettengill was in town and
at her brother's house. She had been there for a whole day
and parts of two others. She would save her money and at
the same time learn the truth.</p>

<p>Turning to Quincy she said, "I cannot afford to pay you,
or rather my mother, a thousand dollars for the secret. It
is not worth it. I will not ask you again for her name,
but if you will answer me one simple question I will
absolve you from your promise."</p>

<p>Quincy reflected. He knew that Lindy was deep and
that she was plotting something while she stood at the window.
But he wished this matter over, he was tired of it,
so he replied, "I will answer your simple question, Miss
Putnam, on one condition. It is that you will not deem
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>me guilty of any intentional discourtesy if, after replying
to it, I at once take my leave."</p>

<p>They faced each other, she hardly able to conceal her
impatience, he with a stern look upon his face.</p>

<p>"My simple question is this, Mr. Sawyer, have you ever
eaten a meal at the same table with my mother's heiress?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen her," replied Quincy coldly. He
took his hat, and with a low bow quitted the house and
drove away.</p>

<p>Lindy threw herself in a passion on the sofa and burst
into a flood of tears. She had played her last card and had
lost.</p><p><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></p>

<h3>AN INFORMAL INTRODUCTION.<br /></h3>

<p>When Quincy drove into the barn he found Jim
Cobb there, and he turned the horse over to him.
Entering by the back door he passed through the kitchen
without seeing either Mandy or Mrs. Crowley, and went
slowly upstairs. The house was very quiet. He remembered
that Uncle Ike had gone to Eastborough Centre and
'Zekiel had gone to Deacon Mason's. It was necessary
for him to pass the door of the room occupied by Alice
Pettengill in order to reach his own room. The door of
her room was open. He involuntarily glanced in and then
stood still.</p>

<p>What vision was this that met his eye? The sun, now
dropping to the westward, threw its rays in at the window
and they fell upon the head of the young girl seated beside
it.</p>

<p>The hair was golden in the sunlight, that real golden that
is seldom seen excepting on the heads of young children.
She seemed slight in figure, but above the average stature.
She wore a loose-fitting dress of light blue material, faced
down the front with white, and over her shoulders was
thrown a small knitted shawl of a light pink color. Quincy
could not see her face, except in profile, for it was turned
towards the window, but the profile was a striking one. He
turned to step forward and enter his own room. As he did
so the board upon which he stood creaked. He stopped
again suddenly, hoping that the noise would not attract
her attention, but her quick ear had caught the sound, and,
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>rising, she advanced towards the door, her hands extended
before her.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Uncle Ike?" she asked in a clear, sweet
voice. "I heard you drive in."</p>

<p>She had started in a straight line towards the door, but
for some cause, perhaps the bright light coming from the
wood fire in the open fireplace, she swerved in her course
and would have walked directly towards the blazing wood
had not Quincy rushed forward, caught her by the hand
and stopped her further progress, saying as he did so, "Miss
Pettengill, you will set your dress on fire."</p>

<p>"You are not Uncle Ike," said she, quickly. "He could
not walk as fast as that. Who are you? You must know
me, for you called me by name."</p>

<p>Quincy replied, "Under the circumstances, Miss Pettengill,
I see no way but to introduce myself. I am your
brother's boarder, and my name is Sawyer."</p>

<p>"I am pleased to meet you, Mr. Sawyer," said she, extending
her hand, which Quincy took. "I feel acquainted
with you already, for Uncle Ike speaks of you very often,
and 'Zekiel said you used to board at Deacon Mason's.
Don't you think Huldy is a lovely girl?"</p>

<p>Quincy avoided this direct question and replied, "Uncle
Ike has been equally kind in speaking of his niece, Miss
Pettengill, so that I feel acquainted with her even without
this,&mdash;I was going to say formal introduction,&mdash;but I think
that we must both confess it was rather informal."</p>

<p>Alice laughed merrily. "Won't you sit down, Mr. Sawyer?
I have been alone nearly all day, and have really been
very lonesome."</p>

<p>She turned and groped, as if feeling for a chair. Quincy
sprang forward, placed a large rocking chair before the
fire, then, taking her hand, saw her safely ensconced in it.
He then took a seat in a large armchair at the end of the
fireplace nearest the door.</p><p><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Sawyer," said Alice. "Everybody has
been so kind to me since I have had this trouble with my
eyes. Of course 'Zekiel has told you about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Quincy.</p>

<p>He really did not care to talk. He was satisfied to sit
and look at her, and he could do this with impunity, for
she could not see his earnest gaze fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"I have been used to an active life," said Alice. "I have
had my business to attend to every day, and evenings I
had my books, papers, pictures, and music. At first it
seemed so hard to be shut out from them all, but years ago
Uncle Ike taught me to be a philosopher and to take life
as it came, without constantly fretting or finding fault.
Uncle Ike says, 'It is not work but worry that wears men
out,' That's why he came down here to live in the woods.
He said they wouldn't let him work and so he worried all
the time, but when he came here he had plenty to do, and
in his work he found happiness."</p>

<p>"I am learning a good lesson," said Quincy with a laugh.
"I have studied much, but I actually never did a day's
work in all my life, Miss Pettengill."</p>

<p>"Then you are to be pitied," said Alice frankly; "but I
see I should not blame you, you are studying now and getting
ready to work."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," Quincy remarked. "My father wishes me
to be a lawyer, but I detest reading law, and have no inclination
to follow in my father's footsteps."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are too young," said Alice, "to settle upon
your future career. I cannot see you, you know, and
Uncle Ike did not say how old you were."</p>

<p>Quincy smiled. "I am in my twenty-fourth year," said
he. "I graduated at Harvard two years ago."</p>

<p>"So old!" exclaimed Alice; "why, I am not twenty-one
until next June, and I have been working for my living
since I was sixteen."</p><p><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></p>

<p>Quincy said, "I wish I had as honorable a record."</p>

<p>"Now you are vexed with me for speaking so plainly,"
said Alice.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Quincy replied. "I thank you for it. I
have learned from Uncle Ike that frankness of speech and
honesty of heart are Pettengill characteristics."</p>

<p>"You might add," said Alice, "firmness in debate, for
none of us like to own up that we are beaten. I remember
years ago Uncle Ike and I had a long discussion as to
whether it were better to be stone blind or stone deaf. I
took the ground that it was better to be blind, for one could
hear music and listen to the voices of friends, and hear the
sound of approaching danger, and then, besides, everybody
is so kind to a person who is blind. But you see Uncle Ike
don't care for music, and had rather talk himself than listen,
so he decided that it was best to be stone deaf, for then
he could read and write to his friends. But of course
neither of us gave in, and the question, so far as we are
concerned, is still unsettled."</p>

<p>At that moment the sound of a team was heard, and a
few minutes later Uncle Ike came upstairs, followed by the
driver of the team bearing a big basket and a large bundle.
These contained Uncle Ike's purchases.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute and I will go upstairs with you," called
out Uncle Ike to the man. He entered the room, and
looking somewhat surprised at seeing Quincy, he said
somewhat sharply, "So you two have got acquainted, have
you? I have been waiting for two days to introduce you."</p>

<p>"I am greatly indebted to Mr. Sawyer," said Alice.
"When he passed my door, which was open, I thought it
was you and I started forward to meet you, but I missed
my way and was walking directly towards the fire, when
Mr. Sawyer interposed."</p>

<p>"I should have done the same thing had it been me,"<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>
said Uncle Ike. "So I don't see as you were in any real
danger."</p>

<p>Quincy thought that it was noticeably evident that the
Pettengills were noted for plainness of speech.</p>

<p>"Here are three letters for you, Alice, and here is one
for you, Mr. Sawyer. I thought I would bring it over to
you as I met Asa Waters down to the post office and he
said you'd started for home. I'll be down in a few minutes,
Alice, and read your letters for you." And Uncle
Ike showed the man the way up to his domicile.</p>

<p>Quincy arose, expressed his pleasure at having met
Miss Pettengill, and presuming they would meet again at
dinner, took his leave.</p>

<p>The letter was from Quincy's father. It was short, but
was long enough to cause Quincy to smother an oath, crush
the letter in his hands and throw it into the open fire. The
flames touched it, and the strong draught took it still ablaze
up the wide-mouthed chimney.</p>

<p>But Quincy's unpleasant thought did not go with it. The
letter had said, "Quinnebaug stock has dropped off five
points. Foss &amp; Follansbee have written Miss Putnam that
she must put up five thousand dollars to cover margin.
Better see her at once and tell her the drop is only temporary,
and the stock is sure to recover."</p>

<p>Quincy sat down in his easy-chair, facing the fire, upon
which he put some more wood, which snapped and crackled.</p>

<p>"I won't go near that girl again," said he, with a determined
look upon his face. The next moment he had banished
Lindy Putnam from his mind, and was thinking of
that other girl who was sitting not six feet from him. He
could hear Uncle Ike's voice, and he knew that Alice's letters
were being read to her. Then he fell into a reverie
as the twilight shadows gathered round him. As the room
grew darker the fire grew brighter, and in it he could seem
to see a picture of a fair-haired girl sitting in a chair and
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>listening with evident interest to a young man who was
reading to her from a newspaper.</p>

<p>The young girl placed her hand upon his arm and asked
a question. The young man dropped the paper and gazed
into the girl's face with a look full of tenderness, and placing
one of his hands upon that of the young girl clasped it
fondly, and Quincy saw that the face of this young man
was his own. He sat there until there came a loud rap upon
the door and Mandy's voice called out, "Supper's ready."</p><p><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></p>

<h3>THE COURTIN'.<br /></h3>

<p>While Quincy was taking his first steps in Lover's
Lane, which steps so often lead to the high road of
Matrimony, 'Zekiel Pettengill had reached the end of his
lane, which had been very long with many devious turns,
and he found himself at that point where the next important
question was to fix the day.</p>

<p>'Zekiel was a strong-minded, self-willed, self-reliant
young man, but in the presence of Huldy Mason he was
as big a coward as the world ever saw. She had sent a
little note to him, saying that she wished to see him that
afternoon, and he knew their fates would be decided that
day. He was hopeful, but the most hopeful lover has
spasms of uncertainty until his lady love has said yes and
yes again.</p>

<p>Dressed in his best, 'Zekiel knocked at Deacon Mason's
front door. For an instant he wished himself safe at home
and debated whether he could get round the corner of the
house before the door was opened. He turned his head to
measure the distance, but at that moment the door was
opened, and Mrs. Mason's smiling face was before him,
and her pleasant, cheery voice said, "Come in, 'Zekiel."</p>

<p>He felt reassured by this, for he argued to himself that
she would have called him Mr. Pettengill if there had been
any change in her feelings towards him. They entered the
parlor, and Mrs. Mason said, "Take off your things and
leave them right here, and go right up and see Huldy.
She is waitin' for you. The doctor's been and gone. He
took that plaster thing off Huldy's arm, says she's all right
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>now, only she must be keerful, not do any heavy liftin' with
it till it gets good and strong. He said it would be some
time before she could help me much with the housework,
so I am going to get a girl for a month or two. I heerd your
sister got home, 'Zeke. They do say she's blind. I am
awful sorry, 'Zekiel. Hope she will get better of it. I am
coming over to see her just as soon as I get me my girl.
But you go right up, there's nobody there but Huldy. Mr.
Sawyer is coming after the nurse to-morrow morning, and
she is up in the spare room trying to catch up with her
sleep. We told her there was no use in setting up with
Huldy, but she said she had her orders from the doctor,
and she wouldn't mind a single thing we said. But we
will get rid on her to-morrow. Now you go right up,
'Zekiel;" and Mrs. Mason took him by the arm and saw
him on his way up the front stairs before she returned to
her work in the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Zekiel went upstairs deliberately, one step at a time.
His footfalls, it seemed to him, must be heard all over the
house. He paused before Huldy's door. He opened it a
couple of inches, when the thought struck him that he
ought to knock. He started to close the door and do so,
when he heard a faint voice say, "Come in, 'Zekiel." So
he was still 'Zekiel to Huldy. He opened the door and
walked bravely into the room, but his bravery forsook him
when he had taken a few steps. He had expected to find
her in bed, as she had been every day before when he had
called. But there she stood before him, the same Huldy
as of old. Not exactly the same, however, for her cheeks
had lost much of their rosy tint and there was a pensive
look to the face that was new to it, which 'Zekiel saw, but
could not understand.</p>

<p>There were two chairs close together before the fire.
She sat down in the left-hand one and motioned 'Zekiel to
the other, which he took.</p><p><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></p>

<p>"I thought I would find you abed," said 'Zekiel. "I
didn't know you were up."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Huldy. "I got up and dressed as soon
as the doctor took the jacket, that's what he called it, off my
arm. I felt so much better I couldn't stay in bed any
longer."</p>

<p>"Well," said 'Zekiel, "when the schoolmaster used to
tell me to take my jacket off I didn't feel near as well as I
did before," and then they both laughed heartily.</p>

<p>They sat silent for a few moments, when Huldy, turning
her face with that sad look towards him, said, "There is
something on my mind, 'Zekiel, that I wish I could take
off as easily as the doctor did that jacket."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," cried 'Zekiel; "why should you have
anything on your mind? You are a little bit low spirited
because you have been cooped up in bed so long."</p>

<p>"No," said Huldy, "that isn't it. I have wronged a person
and I am afraid that person will never fully forgive me.
I am real sorry for what I have done, and I am going to tell
the person and ask for pardon."</p>

<p>"Well," said 'Zekiel, "the person must be pretty mean
spirited if he or she don't forgive you after you say you are
sorry, 'specially if you promise not to do it again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall never do it again," said Huldy. "Once has
nearly killed me. I suffered ten times more from that than
from my broken arm."</p>

<p>"Well," said 'Zekiel, "if that person don't forgive you I
don't want anything more to do with him."</p>

<p>"Let me tell you a little story," said Huldy. "A little
boy and girl whose homes were not a quarter of a mile
apart grew up together in a little country town. As children
they loved each other, and as they grew older that
love really grew stronger, though not so plainly shown or
spoken. Everybody thought that one day they would be
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>married, though he had never asked her to be his wife.
Did you ever hear of anything like that, 'Zekiel?"</p>

<p>"Well," remarked 'Zekiel, "I have in my mind two persons
whose relations were pretty similar up to a certain
point."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Huldy, eagerly, "and that point was reached
when a young man from the city, whose father was known
to be very wealthy, came to board in her father's house."
Huldy looked at 'Zekiel inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard of something like that," said 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>"For a time," continued Huldy, "the young girl was
unfaithful to her old-time lover. She thought the young
man from the city was learning to love her because he was
polite and attentive to her. She thought it would be nice
to be rich and go to the city to live, but the young man
soon undeceived her. He took her to ride one day, and on
their way home he told her he was going to leave her
father's house. She wished to know the reason, but he
would not give it. She divined it, however, and in her agitation
lost control of the horse she was driving. The
buggy was overturned and her arm was broken." She
looked up at 'Zekiel. His face was grave, but he nodded
for her to go on. "She stayed in bed for three weeks, and
during that time she lived over her short life a hundred,
yes, a thousand, times; she knew that her fancy had been
but a fleeting dream. A suspicion that perhaps the young
man had imagined her feelings towards him was what had
nearly broken her heart. Supposing you were the man,
'Zekiel, and I were the woman in this little story, could
you forgive me if I said I was sorry and would never do it
again?"</p>

<p>"I forgave you, Huldy, when I let him come to board in
my house. He told Uncle Ike why he left your father's
house. The folks were talking about you and him, but he
never imagined that you were in love with him, or thought
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>any more about him than you would have of any passing
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," cried Huldy; "you have done me more
good than the doctor, 'Zekiel;" and she dropped her head
upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>'Zekiel was struck with an idea, "If I am a better doctor
than the other one, Huldy, I ought to get a bigger price
for my services than he does."</p>

<p>Huldy looked up. "What will your price be, Dr. Pettengill?"</p>

<p>"I think I shall charge," said 'Zekiel, "one hundred thousand
dollars, and as I know you haven't got the money and
can't raise it, I think I shall have to hold you for security."</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word, and they sat there so
long, happy in their mutual love, that the Deacon and his
wife came upstairs and entered the room quietly. When
they saw the picture before them, thrown into prominence
by the light of the fire, the Deacon said in a low tone to
his wife, "I have thought so all along."</p>

<p>And as Mrs. Mason looked up into her husband's face
she said, "I am glad on't."</p><p><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></p>

<h3>JIM SAWYER'S FUNERAL.<br /></h3>

<p>Quincy obeyed the call to supper with alacrity. Possibly
he thought he would be the first one at the
table, but Cobb's twins were in their places when he entered
the room. 'Zekiel came in next, and Quincy's quick
eye discerned that there was a look of quiet contentment
on his face which had not been there before.</p>

<p>Uncle Ike came down with Alice, and for the first time
since her arrival she sat beside Quincy. For some reason
or other the conversation lagged. Quincy surmised that
'Zekiel was too happy with his own thoughts to wish to
talk, and Uncle Ike rarely conversed during meal time.
He said he could not talk and eat at the same time, and as
meal time was for eating he proposed to give his attention
to that exclusively.</p>

<p>Quincy ventured a few commonplace remarks to Alice,
to which she replied pleasantly. He was at a loss for a
topic, when he remembered his last visit to Mrs. Putnam's
and recalled his promise to bring Alice to see her some
day.</p>

<p>He spoke of visiting Mrs. Putnam, and Alice's face
immediately shone with pleasure. "Dear old Aunt Heppy!
I must go and see her as soon as I can."</p>

<p>"If you can find no better escort than myself, I trust you
will command my services, unless," said Quincy, "your
brother thinks it unsafe to trust you with me."</p>

<p>"He won't be likely to let you drive, Alice," responded
'Zekiel dryly, "so I don't think there will be any danger."</p>

<p>Quincy knew by this remark that Huldy had told 'Zekiel
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>the facts of the case, but he maintained his composure and
said, "Any time you wish to go, Miss Pettengill, I am at
your service."</p>

<p>As they arose from the table 'Zekiel said to his uncle, "I
am coming up in your room to-night, Uncle Ike, to see
you."</p>

<p>Quincy knew by this that the pleasant chat in the dining-room
beside the fireplace was to be omitted that evening, so
he went up to his own room and read until it was time to
retire.</p>

<p>Quincy was up early next morning. He knew his uncle
could not live long, but he wished to take the trained nurse
to Eastborough Centre, so he might have the best of care
during the short time left to him on earth.</p>

<p>He found 'Zekiel at the breakfast table, and beyond a
few commonplace remarks the meal was eaten in silence.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Eastborough Centre to-day, Mr.
Sawyer?" asked 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy; "I intended to go just as soon as
one of the boys could get the team ready."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to Jim about it," said 'Zekiel. "If you will
step into the parlor, Mr. Sawyer, I would like to have a
few minutes' talk with you."</p>

<p>'Zekiel went out into the barn and Quincy walked into
the parlor, where he found a bright fire burning on the
hearth. He threw himself into an easy-chair and awaited
'Zekiel's return. What was up? Could 'Zekiel and Huldy
have parted, and was 'Zekiel glad of it? Quincy, as the
saying is, passed a "bad quarter of an hour," for he did not
like suspense. The truth, however bitter or unpalatable,
was better than uncertainty.</p>

<p>'Zekiel entered the room and took a seat opposite to
Quincy. He bent forward and placed his hands upon his
knees.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer," said he, "I am a man of few words, so I
<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>will come right to the point. Huldy Mason and me are
engaged to be married."</p>

<p>Quincy was equal to the occasion. He arose, stepped
forward, and extended his hand. 'Zekiel rose also and
grasped it unhesitatingly. Quincy said, "Accept my most
sincere congratulations, Mr. Pettengill. I have known Miss
Mason but a short time, but any man ought to be proud of
her and happy in her love."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Sawyer," said 'Zekiel; "I agree with
you in both the particulars you've mentioned, but both of
us have what we consider good reasons for not having our
engagement known in the village just at present, and to
keep it a secret we need the assistance of a mutual friend."</p>

<p>"If I might aspire to that honor," said Quincy, "my time
and services are at your disposal."</p>

<p>"That's what I told Huldy," said 'Zekiel, "but she was
afraid that you would be vexed at what the gossips said
about you and her; she's mad as a hornet herself, and she
wants to teach them a lesson."</p>

<p>"Personally," said Quincy, "I don't care what the gossips
say, but I was both sorry and indignant that they
should have referred to Miss Mason in the way they did."</p>

<p>"Well," said 'Zekiel, "we have hatched up a sort of a
plot, and if you will help us, all three of us will have some
fun out of it."</p>

<p>"Well," inquired Quincy, "what's my share in the fun?"</p>

<p>"It's this," said 'Zekiel, "you know you used to take
Huldy out to ride with you. To help out our plan, would
you be willing to do it again?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Quincy. "Miss Mason has been
confined to her room so long I think she ought to have
some fresh air."</p>

<p>"That's true," remarked 'Zekiel; "she's lost considerable
flesh staying in so long; but if I took her out to ride they
would jump at conclusions right off and say Huldy and<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>
'Zekiel have made up, and they will guess we are going to
make a match of it. Then, again," 'Zekiel continued,
"Huldy says she's bound to have it out with the one that
started the stories. There's no use mincing matters between
us, because you know as well as I do who is at the
bottom of all this tittle-tattle. Since I refused to join hands
with him to try and drive you out of town, he has talked
about me almost as bad as he has about you. 'So,' says
Huldy to me, 'you know he is the only teacher of music
in Eastborough. I want to take music lessons very much,
and so I have got to have him for teacher.' Then she said,
''Zekiel, you leave the rest of it to me, and we will all have
some fun before we get through.' I expect she is going
to flirt with him, for it comes as nat'ral to her as it does
to most women."</p>

<p>Quincy did not think it polite to assent to this last
remark and changed the subject by remarking, "This is a
beautiful day. I am going to drive the nurse over to Eastborough;
perhaps Miss Mason would like to accompany us.
That is, if you can trust her with me."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said 'Zekiel; "Huldy had to pay
pretty dearly for getting mad at the wrong time. Besides,
I don't think she will want to drive horse again for a
while."</p>

<p>Mandy rapped on the parlor door and called out that the
team was ready.</p>

<p>Quincy assured 'Zekiel that he understood his part and
would play it to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Deacon Mason's house he found the
latter just coming out of the front gate. As Quincy
leaped from the team the Deacon came forward and shook
hands with him. "You are just the man I want to see," he
remarked. "I've paid our doctor, but I want to know what
the bill is for the Boston doctor and the nurse."</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," said Quincy, "but there will be nothing
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>for you to pay. It is my duty to settle that bill myself."</p>

<p>"No," said the Deacon firmly. "She is my daughter,
and it is my place as her father to pay such bills, until she
has a husband to pay them for her."</p>

<p>Quincy said, "Deacon Mason, when I took your daughter
out to ride it was my duty to return her to her home
without injury. I did not do so, and I trust that you will
allow me to atone for my neglect. Remember, sir, you
have lost her services for several weeks, and the board of
the nurse has been an expense to you."</p>

<p>"I prefer," rejoined the Deacon, "that the bill should
be sent to me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, to close the discussion, "I will ask
him to send you one;" mentally resolving, when it was
sent, it would be a receipted one.</p>

<p>Quincy received a hearty welcome from Mrs. Mason,
who said the nurse had her things packed and was all ready
to go. He then told Mrs. Mason that he had a message
for Miss Mason from Mr. 'Zekiel Pettengill, and Mrs.
Mason said she would send Huldy to the parlor at once.
Huldy greeted Quincy with a happy face and without any
show of confusion.</p>

<p>"I had a long talk with Mr. Pettengill," said Quincy,
"and he has induced me to become a conspirator. The first
act in our comedy is to ask you if you will ride over to
Eastborough Centre this morning with the nurse and myself,
and get a little fresh air?"</p>

<p>"I should be delighted," said Huldy, "if you can wait
long enough for me to dress."</p>

<p>"That's what I came early for," remarked Quincy.
"How long will it take you?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen minutes," said Huldy.</p>

<p>"It is now half-past seven," remarked Quincy, looking
at his watch. "You mean you will be ready by quarter
of nine?"</p><p><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></p>

<p>"No," said Huldy, with a flash of her eyes, "I am no city
lady. I am a plain, country girl, and I mean just one-quarter
of an hour. You can time me, Mr. Sawyer;" and she
ran gayly out of the room.</p>

<p>Quincy looked out of the window and saw that Hiram
had put the nurse's heavy valise on the front seat of the
carryall. The nurse herself was standing by the side of
the team, evidently uncertain which seat to take. Quincy
was quickly at her side.</p>

<p>"You can sit in here, Miss Miller," said Quincy, pointing
to one of the rear seats; and when she was seated
Quincy told Hiram to put the valise on the seat beside her.
He had no idea of having Huldy take a back seat.</p>

<p>True to her promise, Huldy made her toilet in the
appointed time, and taking her seat beside Quincy, he took
up the reins. Turning to Hiram he asked, "If I drive by
Hill's grocery and take the road to the left, will it bring
me round to the main road to Eastborough Centre again?"</p>

<p>"Yaas," said Hiram, "you take the road where Mis'
Hawkins's boardin' house is on the corner. You remember
that big yellow house. You know I told you Mandy's
mother kept it."</p>

<p>"All right," said Quincy, and off they went.</p>

<p>Quincy gave a side glance at Huldy. He discovered
she was throwing a side glance at him. They both smiled,
but said nothing. He drove around the big tree that stood
in the centre of the square in front of the grocery, which
brought the team quite close to the store platform. No
one was in sight, but just as he reached Mrs. Hawkins's
boarding house the door opened and Obadiah Strout came
out. Huldy placed her hand on Quincy's arm.</p>

<p>"Please hold up a minute, Mr. Sawyer."</p>

<p>Quincy brought the horse to a standstill with a jerk and
looked straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Ah, good morning, Mr. Strout," said Huldy. "Did
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>you get the letter I sent up by Hiram last evening about
my taking music lessons?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Strout, "and I was coming down this
morning to settle on the best time for you taking them."</p>

<p>"Could you come to-morrow afternoon from two to
three?" asked Huldy.</p>

<p>Strout took a well-worn memorandum book from his
pocket and consulted it. "Three to four would be the best
I could do," said he, "for I have a lesson from half-past one
to half-past two."</p>

<p>"That will do just as well," replied Huldy. "Three to
four to-morrow afternoon. Isn't this a beautiful day, Mr.
Strout? I am taking a little drive for my health;" and
she nodded smilingly to Strout, who had recognized
Quincy as her companion.</p>

<p>"That's all, Mr. Sawyer," said Huldy, and they drove on.</p>

<p>"By thunder," said Strout, "they say the hair of a dog
is good for his bite. Just as soon as she got well, off she
goes riding again with the same feller who tipped the
team over and broke her arm. I guess 'Zeke Pettengill's
chances ain't worth much now. It beats all how 'Zeke
can let that feller board in his house, but I suppose he does
it to let us folks see that he don't care. Well, Huldy Mason
is a bright little girl, and I always liked her. That city
chap don't mean to marry her, and if I don't make the best
of my chances when I get to teaching her music, my name
ain't Obadiah Strout, which I guess it is." And he walked
across the square to Hill's grocery to smoke his morning
cigar.</p>

<p>On the way to Eastborough Centre Quincy wondered
what he would do with Huldy when he arrived there. He
did not care to take her to the Poorhouse, and particularly
he did not wish her to see his uncle. Quincy was proud,
but he was also sensible, and he decided upon a course of
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>action that would prevent any one from saying that his
pride had made him do a foolish act.</p>

<p>As they neared the Poorhouse Quincy turned to Huldy
and said, "The Jim Sawyer who has been at the Eastborough
Poorhouse for the last five years is my father's
brother and my uncle. His story is a very sad one. I will
tell it to you some day. He is in the last stages of consumption,
and I am taking Miss Miller over to care for
him while he lives."</p>

<p>Huldy nodded, and nothing more was said until they
reached the Poorhouse. Quincy jumped out and called
to Sam, who was close at hand, to hold the horse. Sam
looked at him with a peculiar expression that Quincy did
not stop to fathom, but running up the short flight of steps
entered the room that served as the office for the Poorhouse.
Mr. Waters was there writing at his desk. He
turned as Quincy entered.</p>

<p>"How is my uncle?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"He is better off than us poor mortals," replied Mr.
Waters with a long-drawn countenance.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Quincy. "Is he dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Waters, "he died about four o'clock this
mornin'. Sam sat up with him till midnight, and I stayed
with him the balance of the time."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry I was not here," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have done any good," said Waters. "He
didn't know what was going on after two o'clock, and you
couldn't have been of any use if you'd been here. If 't had
been daytime I should have sent over for you. He only
spoke once after I went upstairs and that was to say that
you would see to buryin' him."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "I will take charge of the remains."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Mr. Waters, "I called in the town
undertaker and he has got him all ready."</p><p><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></p>

<p>"When does the next train leave for Boston?" asked
Quincy, taking out his watch.</p>

<p>"In just twenty minutes," Waters replied, looking up at
the clock.</p>

<p>"I will be back from Boston at the earliest possible
moment," said Quincy; and before the astonished Waters
could recover himself, the young man had left the room.</p>

<p>Quincy jumped into the team, grasped the reins, and
started off at full speed for Eastborough Centre.</p>

<p>"My uncle died this morning," said he, turning to
Huldy, "I must go to Boston at once to make the necessary
arrangements for his funeral He is to be buried at
Amesbury with his wife and children, so please get word
to Mr. Pettengill that I shall not be home for several days.
I will get some one at the hotel to drive you home, Miss
Mason. Only stern necessity compels me to leave you in
this way."</p>

<p>"You will do nothing of the sort," said Huldy. "I am
perfectly confident that I am able to drive this team home
all by myself."</p>

<p>"I never can consent to it," said Quincy. "If anything
happened to you, your father and&mdash;" Huldy glanced at
him. "I mean," said Quincy, "I should never forgive myself,
and your father would never forgive me. Your arm
is still weak, I know."</p>

<p>"My arm is just as good as ever," said Huldy. "The
doctor told me it wouldn't break in that place again.
Besides, Mr. Sawyer," she said, as the hotel came in sight,
"I shall drive back just the same way we came, and there
are no hills or sharp corners, you know." She laughed
heartily and added, "I shall enjoy it very much, it is part
of the comedy."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy in an undertone, "rebellious young
woman, do as you will, and bear the consequences. I will
turn the team around so that you won't have any trouble,
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>and Hiram can take it down to Mr. Pettengill's and deliver
my message. Good-by," and he shook hands with her.</p>

<p>"We will get out here, Miss Miller," said he, and he
helped the nurse to alight. Grasping the heavy valise, he
started at a brisk pace for the station, and Miss Miller was
obliged to run in order to keep up with him. They boarded
the train and took their seats. The train was ahead of
time and waited for a few minutes at the station.</p>

<p>Quincy did not know as he sped towards Boston on his
sad errand that Miss Lindy Putnam was in the second car
behind him, bound to the same place. Nor did he know
for several days that Abner Stiles, who drove her to the
station, had seen Huldy driving towards Mason's Corner.
Nor did he know that Strout had told Abner of his seeing
Huldy and Sawyer together. Nor did he know that Abner
whipped up his horse in a vain attempt to overtake Huldy
on her return to Mason's Corner. She, too, had whipped
up her horse and had reached home, and was in the house,
calling for Hiram, just as Abner turned into the square by
Hill's grocery.</p>

<p>Quincy made the necessary purchases, and with the city,
undertaker returned to Eastborough Centre by the noon
train. The body was placed in a leaden casket and Quincy
and the undertaker with their sad burden returned to
Boston by the five o'clock express.</p>

<p>His mother and sisters were still in New York, but he
passed the evening with his father, who approved of all
he had done and what he proposed doing.</p>

<p>Quincy went to Amesbury and purchased a small lot in
the cemetery. After a day's search he discovered the place
of burial of his uncle's wife and children. They were disinterred,
and the four bodies were placed in the little lot.</p>

<p>On his return to Boston he made arrangements for two
plain marble stones for his uncle and aunt, and two smaller
ones for his little cousins, whom he had never seen.</p><p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></p>

<p>The directions that he left with the monument maker
and the undertaker at Amesbury were followed to the letter.
If one should pass by that little lot he would see on one
marble slab these words:</p>

<p class="center">
Eunice Raymond Sawyer,<br />
Aged 29 yrs., 6 mos.<br />
</p>

<p>On the little slab at her feet the simple words:</p>

<p class="center">
Mary, Aged 4 yrs., 2 mos.<br />
</p>

<p>At its side another little stone bearing only these words:</p>

<p class="center">
Ray, Aged 6 yrs., 8 mos.<br />
</p>

<p>Adhering strictly to his uncle's request, the other large
stone bore no name, but on it were engraved these words:</p>

<p class="center">
In Heaven we Know our Own.<br />
</p><p><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>A WET DAY.<br /></h3>

<p>When Quincy alighted from the train at Eastborough
Centre, after attending his uncle's funeral, he found
the rain descending in torrents. He hired a closed carriage
and was driven to Mason's Corner, arriving there
about ten o'clock. He had taken his breakfast in
Boston.</p>

<p>When he reached the Pettengill house he saw Hiram
standing at the barn door. Bidding the driver stop, he got
out and paid his score; he then took Hiram by the arm
and led him into the barn. When he had primed the latter
with a good cigar, he said, "Now, Hiram, I've been away
several days and I want to know what has been going on.
You know our agreement was that you should tell me the
whole truth and nothing but the truth. I don't want you
to spare my feelings nor anybody else's. Do you understand?"
said he to Hiram. Hiram nodded. "Then go
ahead," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, first," said Hiram, puffing his cigar with evident
satisfaction, "they got hold of the point that Miss Huldy
drove back alone from Eastborough Centre. Abner Stiles
took Lindy Putnam down to the station and she went to
Boston on the same train that you did. Abner tried to
catch up with Huldy, so he could quiz her, but she whipped
up her horse and got away from him."</p>

<p>"Smart girl!" interjected Quincy.</p>

<p>"You can just bet," said Hiram, "there ain't a smarter
one in this town, though, of course, I think Mandy is pretty
smart, too."</p>

<p>"Mandy's all right," said Quincy; "go ahead."</p><p><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></p>

<p>"Well, secondly, as the ministers say," continued Hiram,
"Lindy Putnam told Abner when he drove her home from
the station that night that the copper company that Mr.
Sawyer told her to put her money in had busted, and she'd
lost lots of money. That's gone all over Mason's Corner,
and if Abner told Asa Waters, it's all over Eastborough
Centre by this time."</p>

<p>"The whole thing is a lie," said Quincy hotly; "the stock
did go down, but my father told me yesterday it had rallied
and would soon advance from five to ten points. What's
the next confounded yarn?"</p>

<p>"Well, thirdly," continued Hiram, "of course everybody
knows Jim Sawyer was your uncle, and somebody said&mdash;you
can guess who&mdash;that it would look better if you would
pay up his back board instead of spending so much money
on a fancy funeral and cheating the town undertaker out
of a job."</p>

<p>"I paid him for all that he did," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hiram, "but this is how it is. You see the
undertaker makes a contract with the town to bury all the
paupers who die during the year for so much money. They
averaged it up and found that about three died a year, so
the town pays the undertaker on that calculation; but this
year, you see, only two have died, and there ain't another
one likely to die before town meeting day, which comes the
first Monday in March, so, you see the undertaker gets paid
for buryin' your uncle, though he didn't do it, and some one
says&mdash;you can guess who&mdash;that he is going to bring the
matter up in town meeting."</p>

<p>Quincy smothered an exclamation and bit savagely into
his cigar.</p>

<p>"Anything else?" inquired he. "Have they abused the
ladies as well as me?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hiram; "you see somebody&mdash;you know who&mdash;is
giving Huldy music lessons and he will keep quiet
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>about her anyway; but he says he can't understand how
'Zeke Pettengill can let you board in his house and go out
riding with Huldy, unless things is up between 'Zeke and
Huldy."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess that's about the size of it," said Quincy.
"Now, for instance, Hiram, you and Mandy are good
friends, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hiram, "after we get over our little difficulties
we are."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I happen to know that 'Zekiel and
Huldy have got over their little difficulties and they are
now good friends."</p>

<p>"Been't they going to get married?" asked Hiram.</p>

<p>"Are you and Mandy going to get married?" asked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't got so far along as to set the day
exactly," said Hiram.</p>

<p>"And I don't believe 'Zekiel and Huldy will get married
any sooner than you and Mandy will," remarked
Quincy. "But don't say a word about this, Hiram."</p>

<p>"Mum's the word," replied Hiram. "I am no speaker,
but I hear a thing or two."</p>

<p>"Now, Hiram," said Quincy, "run in and tell Mandy I'll
be in to lunch as usual, and then come back, for I have
something more to say to you."</p>

<p>Hiram did as directed, and Quincy sat and thought the
situation over. So far he had been patient and he had
borne the slings and arrows hurled at him without making
any return. The time had come to change all that, and
from now on he would take up arms in his own defence,
and even attack his opponents.</p>

<p>When he had reached this conclusion, Hiram reappeared
and resumed his seat on the chopping block.</p>

<p>Quincy asked, "In what regiment did the singing-master
go to war?"</p><p><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></p>

<p>"The same one as I did,&mdash;th Mass.," replied Hiram.</p>

<p>"Did you go to war?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, I rather guess," said Hiram. "I went out as a
bugler; he was a corporal, but he got detailed for hospital
duty, and we left him behind before we got where there
was any fightin'."</p>

<p>"Was he ever wounded in battle?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"One of the sick fellers in the hospital gave him a lickin'
one day, but I don't suppose you'd call that a battle,"
remarked Hiram.</p>

<p>"Well, how about that rigmarole he got off down to the
grocery store that morning?" Quincy interrogated.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was all poppycock," said Hiram. "He said
that just to get even with you, when you were telling about
your grandfathers and grandmothers."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said he. "Were you ever wounded in battle,
Hiram?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was shot onct, but not with a bullet."</p>

<p>"What was it," said Quincy, "a cannon ball?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hiram. "I never was so thunderin' mad in
my life. When I go to regimental reunions the boys just
joke the life out of me. You see I was blowin' my bugle
for a charge, and the boys were goin' ahead in great style,
when a shell struck a fence about twenty feet off. The
shell didn't hit me, but a piece of that darned fence came
whizzin' along and struck me where I eat, and I had a
dozen stummick aches inside o' half a minute. I just
dropped my bugle and clapped my hands on my stummick
and yelled so loud that the boys told me afterwards that
they were afraid I had busted my bugle."</p>

<p>Quincy laid back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"What do the boys say to you when you go to the
reunions?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They tell me to take a little whiskey for my stummick's
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>sake," said Hiram, "and some of them advise me to put on
a plaster, and, darn 'em, they always take me and toss me
in a blanket every time I go, and onct they made me a
present of a bottleful of milk with a piece of rubber hose
on top of it. They said it would be good for me, but I
chucked it at the feller's head, darn him."</p>

<p>Quincy had another good laugh. Then he resumed his
usual grave expression and asked, "What town offices does
the singing-master hold?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hiram, "he is fence viewer and hog reeve
and pound keeper, but the only thing he gets much money
out of is tax collector. He gets two per cent on about
thirty thousand dollars, which gives him about ten dollars a
week on an average, 'cause he don't get no pay if he don't
collect."</p>

<p>"Did he get a big vote for the place?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," said Hiram "he just got in by the skin of his
teeth; he had last town meetin' two more votes than Wallace
Stackpole, and Wallace would have got it anyhow if
it hadn't been for an unfortunate accident."</p>

<p>"How was that?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Hiram, "two or three days before
town meetin' Wallace went up to Boston. He got an oyster
stew for dinner, and it made him kinder sick, and some
one gave him a drink of brandy, and I guess they gave him
a pretty good dose, for when he got to Eastborough Centre
they had to help him off the train, 'cause his legs were
kinder weak. Well, 'Bias Smith, who lives over to West
Eastborough, he is the best talker we've got in town
meetin'. He took up the cudgels for Wallace, and he just
lammed into those mean cusses who'd go back on a man
'cause he was sick and took a little too much medicine.
But Abner Stiles,&mdash;you know Abner,&mdash;well, he's the next
best talker to 'Bias Smith,&mdash;he stood up and said he didn't
think it was safe to trust the town's money to a man who
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>couldn't go to Boston and come home sober, and that
pulled over some of the fellers who'd agreed to vote for
Wallace."</p>

<p>"Has the tax collector performed his duties satisfactorily?"
asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hiram, "Wallace Stackpole told me the
other day that he hadn't got in more than two-thirds of
last year's taxes. He said the selectmen had to borrow
money and there'd be a row at the next town meetin'."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, rising, "I think I will go in and
get ready for lunch. I had a very early breakfast in
Boston."</p>

<p>"Did you have oyster stew?" asked Hiram.</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy, "people who live in Boston never
eat oyster stews at a restaurant. If they did there wouldn't
be enough left for those gentlemen who come from the
country."</p>

<p>He opened the door and Hiram grasped his arm.</p>

<p>"By Gosh! I forgot one thing," he cried. "You remember
Tilly James, that played the pianner at the concert?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "and she was a fine player, too."</p>

<p>"Well," said Hiram, "she's engaged to Sam Hill, you
know, down to the grocery store. That ain't all, old Ben
James, her father, he's a paralytic, you know, and pretty
well fixed for this world's goods, and he wants Benoni to
sell out his grocery when Tilly gets married and come over
and run the farm, which is the biggest one in the town, and
I heerd Abner Stiles say to 'Manuel Howe, that he reckoned
he&mdash;you know who I mean&mdash;would get some fellers
to back him up and he'd buy out the grocery and get
'p'inted postmaster. I guess that's all;" and Hiram started
off towards Deacon Mason's.</p>

<p>Quincy went to his room and prepared for the noonday
meal. While doing so he mentally resolved that the singing-master
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>would not be the next tax collector if he could prevent
it; he also resolved that the same party would not get
the grocery store, if he had money enough to outbid him;
and lastly he felt sure that he had influence enough to
prevent his being appointed postmaster.</p>

<p>Quincy met Ezekiel at lunch. He told Quincy that
everything was working smoothly; that the singing-master
evidently thought he had the field all to himself. He said
Huldy and Alice were old friends, and Huldy was coming
over twice a week to see Alice, and so he shouldn't go
up to Deacon Mason's very often.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Pettengill?" said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Ezekiel, "she isn't used to heavy dinners
at noon, so she had a lunch up in her room. I am going
over to West Eastborough this afternoon with the boys to
see some cows that 'Bias Smith has got to sell. The sun
is coming out and I guess it will be pleasant the rest of the
day."</p>

<p>"'Bias Smith?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"His name is Tobias," said Ezekiel, "but everybody calls
him 'Bias."</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," said Quincy. "You just mention
my name to him, Mr. Pettengill, and say I am coming over
some day with Mr. Stackpole to see him."</p>

<p>'Zekiel smiled. "Going to take a hand yourself?" asked
he.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "the other fellow has been playing
tricks with the pack so long that I think I shall throw down
a card or two myself, and I may trump his next lead."</p>

<p>"By the way," said 'Zekiel, "while you were away Uncle
Ike had our piano tuned and fixed up. It hasn't been
played since Alice went to Boston five years ago. But the
tuner who came from Boston said it was just as good as
ever. So if you hear any noise underneath you this afternoon
you will know what it means."</p><p><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></p>

<p>"Music never troubles me," said Quincy, "I play and
sing myself."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you and Alice will have a good time with
the piano," remarked 'Zekiel as he left the room.</p>

<p>Quincy went back to his room and wrote a letter to a
friend in Boston, asking him to get a certified copy of the
war record of Obadiah Strout, Corporal &mdash;th Mass. Volunteers,
and send it to him at Eastborough Centre as soon
as possible. It was many days before that letter reached
its destination.</p>

<p>He then sat down in his favorite armchair and began
thinking out the details of his aggressive campaign against
the singing-master. He had disposed of his enemy in half
a dozen pitched battles, when the sound of the piano fell
upon his ear.</p>

<p>She was playing. He hoped she was a good musician,
for his taste in that art was critical. He had studied the
best, and he knew it when he heard it sung or played. The
piano was a good one, its tone was full and melodious, and
it was in perfect tone.</p>

<p>He listened intently. He looked and saw that he had
unintentionally left the door of his room ajar. The parlor
door, too, must be open partly, or he could not have heard
so plainly. What was that she was playing? Ah! Mendelssohn.
Those "Songs Without Words" were as familiar
to him as the alphabet. Now it is Beethoven, that beautiful
work, "The Moonlight Sonata," she was evidently trying
to recall her favorites to mind, for of course she could not
be playing by note. Then she strayed into a "valse" by
Chopin, and followed it with a dashing galop by some
unknown composer. "She is a classical musician," said
Quincy to himself, as the first bars of a Rhapsodic Hongroise
by Liszt fell upon his ear. "I hope she knows some
of the old English ballads and the best of the popular
songs," thought Quincy.</p><p><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></p>

<p>As if in answer to his wish she played that sterling old
song, "Tis but a Little Faded Flower," and Quincy listened
with pleasure to the pure, sweet, soprano voice that
rang out full and strong and seemed to reach and permeate
every nook and corner in the old homestead.</p>

<p>Quincy could stand it no longer. He stepped quietly
to his door, opened it wide, and listened with delight to the
closing lines of the song.</p>

<p>Then she sang that song that thrilled the hearts of thousands
of English soldiers in the Crimea on the eve of the
battle of Inkermann, "Annie Laurie," and it was with difficulty
that Quincy refrained from joining in the chorus.
Surely Annie Laurie could have been no purer, no sweeter,
no more beautiful, than Alice Pettengill; and Quincy felt
that he could do and die for the girl who was singing in the
parlor, as truly as would have the discarded suitor who
wrote the immortal song.</p>

<p>But Quincy was destined to be still more astonished.
Alice played a short prelude that seemed familiar to him,
and then her voice rang out the words of that beautiful
duet that Quincy had sung with Lindy Putnam at the
singing-master's concert. Yes, it was Jewell's "Over the
Bridge." This was too much for Quincy. He went quietly
down the stairs and looked in at the parlor door, which
was wide open. Alice was seated at the piano, and again
the sun, in its westward downward course, shone in at the
window, and lighted up her crown of golden hair. This
time she had reversed the colors which she evidently knew
became her so well, and wore a dress of light pink, while
a light blue knitted shawl, similar to its pink companion,
lay upon the chair beside her.</p>

<p>When she reached the duet Quincy did not attempt to
control himself any further, but joined in with her, and
they sang the piece together to the end.</p><p><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></p>

<p>Alice turned upon the piano stool, faced the door and
clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"That was capital, Mr. Sawyer. I didn't know that you
sang so well. In fact, I didn't know that you sang at all."</p>

<p>"How did you know it was I?" said Quincy, as he advanced
towards her. "It is a little cool here, Miss Pettengill.
Allow me to place your shawl about you;" and, suiting
the action to the word, he put it gently over her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, "I put it on when I first came down.
It interfered with my playing and I threw it into the chair."</p>

<p>"May I take the chair, now that it is unoccupied?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Alice, "if you will give me your word of
honor that you did not try to make me think it was cold:
here, so that you could get the chair."</p>

<p>Quincy replied with a laugh, "If I did my reward is a
great return for my power of invention, but I assure you
I was thinking of your health and not of the chair, when
I tendered my services."</p>

<p>"You are an adept in sweet speeches, Mr. Sawyer. You
city young men all are; but our country youth, who are
just as true and honest, are at a great disadvantage, because
they cannot say what they think in so pleasing a
way."</p>

<p>"I hope you do not think I am insincere," remarked
Quincy, gravely.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Alice, "but I have not answered your
question. How did I know that it was you? You must
remember, Mr. Sawyer, that those who cannot see have
their hearing accentuated, and the ear kindly sends those
pictures to the brain which unfortunately the eye cannot
supply."</p>

<p>"I have enjoyed your playing and singing immensely,"
said Quincy. "Let us try that duet again."</p><p><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></p>

<p>They sang it again, and then they went from piece to
piece, each suggesting her or his favorite, and it was not
till Mandy's shrill voice once more called out with more
than usual force and sharpness, "Supper's ready," that the
piano was closed and Quincy, for the first time taking
Alice's hand in his, led her from the parlor, which was
almost shrouded in darkness, into the bright light of the
dining-room, where they took their accustomed seats.
They ate but little, their hearts were full of the melody that
each had enjoyed so much.</p><p><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></p>

<h3>SOME MORE NEW IDEAS.<br /></h3>

<p>When Ezekiel and Cobb's twins returned from West
Eastborough, they said the air felt like snow.
Mandy had kept some supper for them. Ezekiel said they
had supper over to Eastborough Centre, but the home
cooking smelled so good that all three sat down in the
kitchen and disposed of what Mandy had provided.</p>

<p>The other members of the Pettengill household were in
their respective rooms. Uncle Ike was reading a magazine.
Alice had not retired, for Mandy always came to
her room before she did so to see that her fire was all right
for the night. Alice was a great lover of music and she
had enjoyed the afternoon almost as much as Quincy had.
She could not help thinking what musical treats might be
in store for them, and then the thought came to her how
she would miss him when he went back to Boston.</p>

<p>In the next room, Quincy was pursuing a similar line of
thought. He was thinking of the nice times that Alice
and he could have singing together. To be sure he wished
to do nothing to make his father angry, for Quincy appreciated
the power of money. He knew that with his
mother's third deducted, his fathers estate would give him
between two and three hundred thousand dollars. He had
some money in his own right left him by a fond aunt, his
father's sister, the income from which gave him a good
living without calling upon his father.</p>

<p>He knew his father wished him to become a lawyer, and
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>keep up the old firm which was so well known in legal and
business circles, but Quincy in his heart realized that he
was not equal to it, and the future had little attraction for
him, if it were to be passed in the law offices of Sawyer,
Crowninshield, &amp; Lawrence. At any rate his health was
not fully restored and he determined to stay at Mason's
Corner as long as he could do so without causing a break
in the friendly relations existing between his father and
himself. His present income was enough for his personal
needs, but it was not sufficient to also support a Mrs.
Quincy Adams Sawyer.</p>

<p>What Ezekiel had prophesied came true. No one knew
just when the storm began, but the picture that greeted
Mandy Skinner's eyes when she came down to get breakfast
was a great contrast to that of the previous day.</p>

<p>The snow had fallen steadily in large, heavy flakes, the
road and the fields showed an even, unbroken surface of
white; the tops of the taller fences were yet above the
snow line, each post wearing a white cap. As the morning
advanced the storm increased, the wind blew, and great
drifts were indications of its power. The thick clouds of
white flakes were thrown in every direction, and only dire
necessity, it seemed, would be a sufficient reason for leaving
a comfortable fireside.</p>

<p>Mandy and Mrs. Crowley were busily engaged in preparing
the morning meal, when a loud scratching at a
door, which led into a large room that was used as an addition
to the kitchen, attracted their attention. In bounded
Swiss, the big St. Bernard dog belonging to Uncle Ike.
At Uncle Ike's special request Swiss had not been banished
to the barn or the wood-shed, but had been allowed to sleep
on a pallet in the corner of the large room referred to.</p>

<p>Swiss was a great favorite with Mandy, and he was a
great friend of hers, for Swiss was very particular about
his food, and he had found Mandy to be a much better
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>cook than Uncle Ike had been; besides the fare was more
bounteous at the Pettengill homestead than down at the
chicken coop, and Swiss had gained in weight and strength
since his change of quarters.</p>

<p>After breakfast Uncle Ike came into the kitchen and
received a warm welcome from Swiss. Uncle Ike told
Mandy and Mrs. Crowley the well-known story of the
rescues of lost travellers made by the St. Bernard dogs on
the snow-clad mountains of Switzerland. When Mrs.
Crowley learned that Swiss had come from a country a
great many miles farther away from America than Ireland
was, he rose greatly in her estimation and she made no
objection to his occupying a warm corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p>About noon, when the storm was at its very worst,
Mandy, who was looking out of the kitchen window, espied
something black in the road about halfway between Deacon
Mason's and the Pettengill house. She called Mrs. Crowley
to the window and asked her what she thought it was.</p>

<p>"That's aisy," said Mrs. Crowley, "It's a man coming
down the road."</p>

<p>"What can bring a man out in such a storm as this?"
asked Mandy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is going for the docther," remarked Mrs.
Crowley.</p>

<p>"Then he would be going the other way," asserted
Mandy.</p>

<p>"He's a plucky little divil anyway," said Mrs. Crowley.</p>

<p>"That's so," said Mandy. "He is all right as long as
he keeps on his feet, but if he should fall down&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment the man did fall down or disappear from
sight. Mandy pressed her face against the window pane
and looked with strained eyes. He was up again, she
could see the dark clothing above the top of the snow.</p>

<p>What was that! A cry? The sound was repeated.</p>

<p>"I do believe the man is calling for help," cried Mandy.</p>

<p><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></p>

<p><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></p>

<p>She rushed to the kitchen door and opened it. A gust
of snow swept into the room, followed by a stream of cold,
chilling air. Swiss awoke from his nap and lifted, his head.
Despite the storm, Mandy stood at the door and screamed
"Hello!" with her sharp, strident voice. Could she believe
her ears? Through the howling storm came a word
uttered in a voice which her woman's heart at once recognized.
The word was "Mandy," and the voice was Hiram's.</p>

<p>"What on earth is he out in this storm for?" said Mandy
to herself. She called back in response, "Hello! Hello!
Hello!" and once more her own name was borne to her
through the beating, driving storm.</p>

<p>She shut the door and resumed her post at the window.
Hiram was still struggling manfully against the storm and
had made considerable progress.</p>

<p>Mandy turned to Mrs. Crowley and said, "Mr. Maxwell
is coming, Mrs. Crowley."</p>

<p>"More fool he," remarked Mrs. Crowley, "to be out in
a storm like this."</p>

<p>"Get some cider, Mrs. Crowley," said Mandy, "and put
it on the stove. He will need a good warm drink when he
gets here."</p>

<p>"If he was a son of mine he'd get a good warmin'," said
Mrs. Crowley, as she went down cellar to get the cider.</p>

<p>Mandy still strained her eyes at the window. The dark
form was still visible, moving slowly through the snow.
At that moment a terrific storm of wind struck the house;
it made every window and timber rattle; great clouds of
snow were swept up from the ground to mingle with those
coming from above, and the two were thrown into a
whirling eddy that struck the poor traveller and took him
from his feet, covering him from sight. Mandy rushed to
the door and opened it. This time she did not scream
"Hello." The word this time was "Hiram! He is lost!
He is lost!" she cried. "His strength has given out; but
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>what shall I do? I could not reach him if I tried. Oh,
Hiram! Hiram!" and the poor girl burst into tears. She
would call Mr. Pettengill; she would call Cobb's twins;
she would call Mr. Sawyer; one of them would surely go
to his assistance.</p>

<p>She turned, and to her surprise found Swiss by her side,
looking up at her with his large, intelligent eyes. Quick
as lightning, Uncle Ike's story came back to her mind.
She patted Swiss on the head, and pointed out into the
storm.</p>

<p>Not another word was needed. With a bound Swiss
went into the snow and rapidly forward in the direction
of the road. Mandy was obliged to close the door again
and resume her place at the window. How her heart beat!
How she watched the dog as he ploughed his way through
the drifts? He must be near the place. Yes, he is scratching
and digging down into the snow. Now the dark form
appears once more. Yes, Hiram is on his feet again and
man and dog resume their fight with the elements.</p>

<p>It seemed an age to Mandy, but it was in reality not
more than five minutes, before Hiram and Swiss reached
the kitchen door and came into the room.</p>

<p>"Come out into the back room," said Mandy to Hiram.
"I don't want this snow all over my kitchen floor." So
Hiram and Swiss were taken into the big room and in a
short time came back in presentable condition.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Maxwell, if you have recovered the use of
your tongue, will you kindly inform me what sent you
out in such a storm as this?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hiram, "I reckoned I'd git down kinder
early in the mornin' and git back afore dark."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mandy; "but that don't tell me
what you are out for, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't suppose," said Hiram, "that I could go
all day long without seein' you, did yer, Mandy?"</p><p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></p>

<p>Mrs. Crowley chuckled to herself and went into the
side room. Even Swiss seemed to recognize that two were
company and he followed Mrs. Crowley and resumed his
old resting place in the corner on the pallet.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Crowley went about her work, she chuckled
again, and said to herself, "It's a weddin' I'll be goin' to
next time in place of a funeral."</p>

<p>Upstairs other important events were taking place.
Quincy had gone to his room directly after breakfast, and
looked out upon the wild scene of storm with a sense of
loneliness that had not hitherto oppressed him. Why
should he be lonely? Was he not in the same house with
her, with only a thin wall of wood and plaster between
them? Yes, but if that wall had been of granite one hundred
feet thick, it could not have shut him off more effectually
from seeing her lovely face and hearing her sweet
voice.</p>

<p>There came a sharp rap at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," called out Quincy.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Uncle Ike as he entered, "I am glad to see
you have a good fire. The snow has blown down into
Alice's room and her fire is out. Will you let her step
in here for a few moments, Mr. Sawyer, until 'Zeke and I
get the room warm again?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," replied Quincy. "I am only too
happy&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Uncle Ike was off, and returned in a few moments
leading Alice. Quincy placed a chair for her before the
fire. This cold wintry day she wore a morning dress of
a shade of red which, despite its bright color, seemed to
harmonize with the golden hair and to take the place of
the sun, which was not there to light it up.</p>

<p>"If Miss Pettengill prefers," said Quincy, "I can make
myself comfortable in the dining-room, and she can have
my room to herself."</p><p><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></p>

<p>He had started this speech to Uncle Ike, who left the
room abruptly in the middle of it, and Quincy's closing
words fell on Alice's ears alone.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly not," said Alice; "sit down, Mr. Sawyer,
and we will talk about something. Don't you think it is
terrible?" As Quincy was contemplating his fair visitor,
he could hardly be expected to say "yes" to her question.
"Perhaps you enjoy it?" said she.</p>

<p>"I certainly do," answered Quincy, throwing his whole
heart into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, I must differ with you," said Alice. "I never
did like snow."</p>

<p>"Oh, you were talking about the weather!" remarked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Alice. "What else did you think I
was talking about?"</p>

<p>Quincy, cool and self-possessed as he invariably was,
was a trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p>Turning to Alice he said, "I see, Miss Pettengill, that
I must make you a frank statement in order that you may
retain your respect for me. I know you will pardon me
for not hearing what you said, and for what I am about
to say; but the fact is, I was wondering whether you have
had the best advice and assistance that the medical science
of to-day can afford you as regards your eyes."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, Mr. Sawyer, to think of me, and
my trouble, and I will answer you in the same friendly
way in which you have spoken. I was taken sick one
morning just as I was eating my breakfast I never felt
better in my life than I did that morning, but the pain in
my side was so intense, so agonizing, that by the time I
reached my room and threw myself on the bed, physically
I was a complete wreck. A doctor was called at once and
he remained with me from eight o'clock until noon before
I became comfortable. I thought I was going to get better
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>right off, or I should have written to 'Zekiel. Two other
attacks, each more severe than the one preceding, followed
the first, and I was so sick that writing, or telling any one
else what to write, or where to write, was impossible. Then
I began slowly to recover, but I was very weak and what
made me feel worse than ever was the fact that the trouble
with my eyes, which before my illness I had attributed to
nearsightedness, was now so marked that I could not see
across the room. I could not even see to turn a spoonful
of medicine from a bottle on the table beside my bed. The
Pettengills, Mr. Sawyer, are a self-reliant race, and I concluded
in my own mind that the trouble with my eyes was
due to my illness, and that when I recovered from that,
they would get well; but they did not. I was able, physically,
to resume my work, but I could not see to read or write. I
sent for my employer and told him my condition. He
advised me to consult an oculist at once. In fact, he got a
carriage and took me to one himself. The oculist said that
the treatment would require at least three months; so my
employer told me I had better come home, and that when
I recovered I could have my place back again. He is a
fine, generous-hearted man and I should be very miserable
if I thought I was going to lose my place."</p>

<p>"But what did the oculist say was the trouble with your
eyes?" Quincy asked.</p>

<p>"He didn't tell me," replied Alice. "He may have told
my employer. He gave me some drops to put in my eyes
three times a day; and a little metal tube with a cover to it
like the top of a pepper box; on the other end is a piece of
rubber tubing, with a glass mouthpiece attached to it"</p>

<p>"How do you use that?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>Alice continued, "I hold the pepper box in front of my
wide-opened eye; then I put the glass mouthpiece in my
mouth and blow, for a certain length of time. I don't know
how long it is. It seems as though a thousand needles
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>were driven into my eyeball. The drops make me cry; but
the little tube brings the tears in torrents."</p>

<p>"Isn't that harsh treatment?" asked Quincy, as he looked
at the beautiful blue but sightless eyes that were turned
towards him.</p>

<p>"No," said Alice with a laugh, "the pain and the tears
are like an April shower, for both soon pass away."</p>

<p>At this moment Uncle Ike entered the room and Ezekiel's
steps were heard descending the stairs. Uncle Ike
said, "We have got it started and 'Zeke's gone down to
bring up a good stock of wood. If you have no objection,
Mr. Sawyer, I will sit down here a few minutes. Don't let
me interrupt your conversation."</p>

<p>"I hope you will take a part in it," said Quincy. "You
put a lot of new ideas into my head the first time I came
to see you, and perhaps you may have some more new
ones for me to-day. Miss Pettengill was just saying she
would feel miserable if she lost her situation."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," said Uncle Ike. "The Pettengills
are not afraid to work. If a man is obliged to earn
his living by the sweat of his brow, I don't see why woman
shouldn't do the same thing."</p>

<p>"But the home is woman's sphere," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" cried Uncle Ike.</p>

<p>"Why, Uncle!" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Sawyer understands me!" said Uncle Ike. "In
the Middle Ages, when women occupied the highest position
that has fallen to her lot since the days of Adam, the
housework was done by menials and scullions. Has the
world progressed when woman is pulled down from her
high estate and this life of drudgery is called her sphere?
Beg your pardon, Mr. Sawyer, but there should be no
more limit fixed to the usefulness of woman than there is to
the usefulness of man."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Alice, "I don't think Mr. Sawyer means
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>that exactly. He means a woman should stay at home
and look after her family."</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Ike, "so should the man. I am inclined
to think if the father spent more time at home, it
would be for the advantage of both sons and daughters."</p>

<p>"But," said Quincy, "do you think it is for the best interests
of the community that woman should force her
way into all branches of industry and compete with man
for a livelihood?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Uncle Ike. "In the old days when they
didn't work, for they didn't know how and didn't want to,
because they thought it was beneath them, if a man died,
his wife and children became dependent upon some brother
or sister or uncle or aunt, and they were obliged to provide
for them out of their own small income or savings. In
those days it was respectable to be genteelly poor, and
starve rather than work and live on the fat of the land.
Nothing has ever done so much to increase the self-respect
of woman, and add to her feeling of independence, as the
knowledge of the fact that she can support herself." Alice
bowed her head and covered her eyes with her hand.
"There's nothing personal in what I say," said Uncle Ike.
"I am only talking on general principles."</p>

<p>Quincy yearned to say something against Uncle Ike's
argument, but how could he advance anything against
woman's work when the one who sat before him was a
workingwoman and was weeping because she could not
work? There was one thing he could do, he could change
the subject to one where there was an opportunity for
debate. So he said, "Well, Mr. Pettengill, I presume if
you are such an ardent advocate of woman's right or even
duty to work, that you are also a supporter of her right to
vote."</p>

<p>"That does not follow," replied Uncle Ike. "To be self-reliant,
independent, and self-supporting is a pleasure and a
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>duty, and adds to one's self-respect. As voting is done at
the present day, I do not see how woman can take part in it
and maintain her self-respect. Improvements no doubt
will be made in the manner of voting. The ballot will
become secret, and the count will not be disclosed until
after the voting is finished. The rum stores will be closed
on voting day and an air of respectability will be given to
it that it does not now possess. It ought to be made a legal
holiday."</p>

<p>"Granted," said Quincy, "but what has that to do with
the question of woman's right to vote?"</p>

<p>"Woman has no inherent right to vote," said Uncle Ike.
"The ballot is a privilege, not a right. Why, I remember
reading during the war that young soldiers, between
eighteen and twenty-one years of age, claimed the ballot
as a right, because they were fighting for their country.
If voting is a right, what argument could be used against
their claim?"</p>

<p>"I remember," added Quincy, "that they argued that
'bullets should win ballots.' Do you think any one should
vote who cannot fight?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"If he does not shirk his duty between eighteen and
forty-five," said Uncle Ike, "he should not be deprived of
his ballot when he is older; but the question of woman's
voting does not depend upon her ability to fight. The
mother at home thinking of her son, the sister thinking of
her brother, the wife thinking of her husband, are as loyally
fighting for their native land as the soldiers in the
field, and no soldier is braver than the hospital nurse, who,
day after day and night after night, watches by the bedsides
of the wounded, the sick, and the dying. No, Mr.
Sawyer, it is not a question of fighting or bravery."</p>

<p>During the discussion Alice had dried her eyes and was
listening to her uncle's words. She now asked a question,
"When will women vote, Uncle?"</p><p><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></p>

<p>"When it is deemed expedient for them to do so," replied
Uncle Ike. "The full privilege will not be given all at once.
They will probably be allowed to vote on some one matter
in which they are deeply interested. Education and the
rum question are the ones most likely to be acted upon
first. But the full ballot will not come, and now I know
Alice will shake her head and say, 'No!' I repeat it&mdash;the
full ballot will not come for woman until our social superstructure
is changed. Woman will not become the political
equal of man until she is his social and industrial equal; and
until any contract of whatever nature made by a man and a
woman may be dissolved by them by mutual consent, without
their becoming criminals in the eye of the law, or outcasts
in the eyes of society."</p>

<p>At this moment Ezekiel looked in the door and said,
"Alice's room is nice and warm now." Advancing, he
took her hand and led her from the room. Uncle Ike
thanked Quincy for his kindness and followed them.
Quincy sat and thought. The picture that his mind drew
placed the woman who had just left his room in a large
house, with servants at her command. She was the head
of the household, but no menial nor scullion. She did not
work, because he was able and willing to support her. She
did not vote, because she felt with him that at home was
her sphere of usefulness; and then Quincy thought that
what would make this possible was money, money that not
he but others had earned, and he knew that without this
money the question could not be solved as his mind had
pictured it; and he reflected that all women could not have
great houses and servants and loving husbands to care for
them, and he acknowledged to himself that his solution
was a personal, selfish one and not one that would answer
for the toiling million's of the working world.</p><p><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></p>

<h3>AFTER THE GREAT SNOWSTORM.<br /></h3>

<p>Mandy was, of course, greatly pleased inwardly because
Hiram had come through such a great storm
to see her, but, woman-like, she would not show it.</p>

<p>So she said to Hiram, "Your reason is a very good one,
and of course I am greatly flattered, but there must be
something else besides that. Now, what have you got to
tell me?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, Mandy, I've got two things on my
mind. One of 'em is a secret and t'other isn't. I meant
to have told you yesterday; but Mr. Sawyer kept me busy
till noon, and the Deacon kept me busy all the afternoon,
and I was too tired to come over last night."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mandy, "tell me the secret first. If the
other one has kept so long it won't spoil if it's kept a little
longer."</p>

<p>Hiram had kept his eyes on the stove since taking his
seat, and he then remarked, "I am afraid that cider will
spoil unless I get a drink of it pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," cried Mandy, "if I didn't forget to
give it to you, after sending Mrs. Crowley down stairs for
it, when you was out there in the road."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Hiram, as he finished the mugful
she passed him, and handed it back to be refilled. "That
sort o' limbers a feller's tongue a bit. Well, the secret is,"
said Hiram, lowering his voice, "that when Huldy saw me
gettin' ready to go out, sez she, 'Where are you goin'?'<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
'Over to Mr. Pettengill's,' sez I. Then sez she, 'Will you
wait a minute till I write a note?' 'Certainly,' sez I. And
when she brought me the note, sez she, 'Please give that
to Mr. Pettengill and don't let anybody else see it.' Then
sez I to her, 'No, ma'am;' but I sez to myself, 'Nobody
but Mandy.'" And Hiram took from an inside pocket
an envelope, addressed to Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill, and
showed it to Mandy. Then he put it back quickly in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?" asked Mandy. "That's no great
secret."</p>

<p>"Well, not in itself," said Hiram; "but I am willing to
bet a year's salary agin a big red apple that those two
people have made up and are engaged reg'lar fashion."</p>

<p>"You don't say so," cried Mandy, "what makes you
think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, a number of things," said Hiram. "I overheard
the Deacon say to Huldy, 'It will be pretty lonesome for
us one of these days,' and then you see Mrs. Mason, she is
just as good as pie to me all the time, and that shows something
has pleased her more than common; and then you
see Huldy has that sort of look about her that girls have
when their market's made, and they feel so happy that they
can't help showing it. You see, Mandy, I'm no chicken.
I've had lots of experience."</p>

<p>What Mandy might have said in reply to this remark
will never be known, for at this juncture Ezekiel entered
the room and passed through on his way to the wood-shed.</p>

<p>"Now's my time," said Hiram, and he arose and followed
him out.</p>

<p>Ezekiel was piling up some wood which he was to take
to Alice's room, when Hiram came up beside him and
slyly passed him the note. Then Hiram looked out of the
wood-shed window at the storm, which had lost none of its
fury, while Ezekiel read the note.</p><p><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></p>

<p>"Are you going home soon?" asked Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I'll try it again," said Hiram, "as soon as
I get warm and kinder limbered up."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll go back with you," said Ezekiel. "We will
take Swiss with us; two men and a dog ought to be enough
for a little snowstorm like this."</p>

<p>"You won't find it a little one," said Hiram, "when you
get out in the road, but I guess the three on us can pull
through."</p>

<p>Ezekiel went upstairs with the wood and Hiram resumed
his seat before the kitchen fire.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" said Hiram to Mandy. "'Zeke's
going back with me. She has writ him to come over and
see her. Now you see if you don't lose your apple."</p>

<p>"I didn't bet," said Mandy; "but what was that other
thing you were going to tell me that was no secret?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's about another couple," said Hiram. "Tilly
James is engaged."</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time," said Mandy. "Which one of
them?"</p>

<p>"Samuel Hill," replied Hiram, "and she managed it fust
rate. You know the boys have been flocking round her
for more than a year. Old Ben James, her pa, told me
he'd got to put in a new hitchin' post. You see, there has
been Robert Wood and 'Manuel Howe and Arthur Scates
and Cobb's twins and Ben Bates and Sam Hill, but Samuel
was the cutest one of the lot."</p>

<p>"Why, what did he do that was bright?" asked Mandy.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Hiram, "you see, Tilly sot down and
writ invites to all the boys that had been sparkin' 'round
her to come to see her the same night. She gave these
invites to her brother Bill to deliver. Well, Sam Hill
met him, found out what he was about, and kinder surmised
what it all meant. Wall, the night came 'round and
Sam Hill was the only one that turned up at the time
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>app'inted. After talkin' about the weather, last year's
crops, and spring plantin', Sam just braced up and proposed,
and Tilly accepted him on the spot."</p>

<p>"Where were the other fellers?" asked Mandy. "I
always surmised that she thought more of Ben Bates than
she did of Sam Hill."</p>

<p>"Well, it didn't come out till a couple of days afterwards,"
said Hiram. "You see, the shortest way to old James's
place is to go over the mill race, and all of the fellers but
Sam Hill went that way, and the joke of it was that they
all fell over into the river and got a duckin'."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mandy, "they must have been drinking.
Tilly is well rid of the whole lot of them. Why, I've walked
over that log time and time again."</p>

<p>"Well, they hadn't been drinkin'," said Hiram. "You
see it was pretty dark and they didn't get on to the fact that
the log was greased till it was kinder too late to rectify
matters."</p>

<p>"And did Sam Hill do that?" asked Mandy.</p>

<p>"He did," said Hiram; and he burst into a loud laugh,
in which Mandy joined.</p>

<p>The laughing was quickly hushed as the kitchen door
opened and Ezekiel entered, warmly dressed for his fight
with the snow and carrying a heavy cane in his hand.</p>

<p>"Call the dog, Hiram," said Ezekiel, "and we'll start.
Mandy, tell Jim and Bill to come over to Deacon Mason's
for me about four o'clock, unless it looks too bad; if it does
they needn't try it till to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"All ready," said he to Hiram, who was patting Swiss's
head, and off they started.</p>

<p>Again Mandy went to the window and watched the
progress of the travellers. Mrs. Crowley came into the
kitchen and seeing Mandy at the window quietly turned
out a mug of the hot cider and drank it. She then approached<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>
Mandy and said, "What was all the laughin'
about? I like a good joke myself."</p>

<p>Mandy said, "Oh, he was telling me about a girl that
invited all her fellers to come and see her the same evening,
and only one of them got there because he greased the
log over the mill race, and all the rest of them fell into the
water."</p>

<p>"It was a mane trick," said Mrs. Crowley. "Now, when
all the boys were after me, for I was a good lookin' girl
once, Pat Crowley, he was me husband, had a fight on
hand every night for a fortnight and all on account of me;
and they do say there were never so many heads broken
in the County of Tipperary on account of one girl since the
days of St. Patrick."</p>

<p>Mandy had paid but little attention to Mrs. Crowley's
speech. She was too busy watching the travellers. Mrs.
Crowley filled and emptied the mug once more.</p>

<p>The last potation was too much for her equilibrium, and
forgetting the step that led from the kitchen to the side
room, she lost her balance and fell prone upon the floor.
Her loud cries obliged Mandy to turn from the window,
but not until she had seen that the travellers had reached
the fence before Deacon Mason's house, and she knew they
were safe for the present. Mrs. Crowley was lifted to her
feet by Mandy. The old woman declared that she was
"kilt intirely," but Mandy soon learned the cause of the
accident, and returning to the kitchen closed the door and
continued her morning duties.</p>

<p>Before Ezekiel left the house he had interrupted
Quincy's meditations by knocking on his door, and when
admitted told him that he had had a letter from Huldy.</p>

<p>"She is kind of lonesome," he said, "and wants me to
come over to see her."</p>

<p>"But it is a terrible storm," said Quincy, looking out of
the window.</p><p><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></p>

<p>"Oh," said Ezekiel, "we'll be all right! Hiram is going
with me, and we are going to take Swiss along with us.
Now, Mr. Sawyer, I am going to ask you to do me and
Alice a favor. Uncle Ike is upstairs busy reading, and if
you will kinder look out for Alice till I get back I shall be
greatly obliged."</p>

<p>Quincy promised and Ezekiel departed.</p>

<p>Quincy thought the fates had favored him in imposing
upon him such a pleasant task. But where was she, and
what could he do to amuse her? Then he thought, "We
can sing together as we did yesterday."</p>

<p>He went down stairs to the parlor, thinking she might be
there, but the room was empty. The fire was low, but the
supply of wood was ample, and in a short time the great
room was warm and comfortable. Quincy seated himself
at the piano, played a couple of pieces and then sang a
couple; he did not think while singing the second song that
he had possibly transcended propriety, but when he sang
the closing lines of "Alice, Where Art Thou?" it suddenly
dawned upon him, and, full of vexation, he arose and
walked to the window and looked out upon the howling
storm.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a sweet voice say, "I am here." And
then a low laugh reached his ear.</p>

<p>Turning, he saw Alice standing in the middle of the
room, while Mandy's retreating figure showed who had
been her escort. Her brother Ezekiel had rigged a bell
wire from her room to the kitchen, so that she could call
Mandy when she needed her assistance.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Pettengill," said Quincy, advancing
towards her. "The song has always been a favorite
of mine, but I never thought of its personal application
until I reached the closing words. I trust you do not
think I was so presuming as to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Alice smiled and said, "The song is also a favorite one of
<a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>mine, Mr. Sawyer, and you sang it beautifully. No apologies
are needed, for the fact is I was just saying to myself,
'Mr. Sawyer, where are you?' for 'Zekiel told me that he
was going to speak to you and ask you to help me drive
away those lonesome feelings that always come to me on a
day like this. I cannot see the storm, but I can hear it and
feel it."</p>

<p>As Quincy advanced towards her he saw she held several
sheets of paper in her hand.</p>

<p>"I am at your service," said he. "I am only afraid that
your requirements will exceed my ability."</p>

<p>"Very prettily spoken," said Alice, as Quincy led her
to a seat by the fire, and took one himself. "I am going to
confess to you," said she, "one of my criminal acts. I am
going to ask you to sit as judge and mete out what you
consider a suitable punishment for my offence."</p>

<p>"What crime have you committed?" asked Quincy
gravely.</p>

<p>Alice laughed, shook the papers she held in her hand,
and said, "I have written poetry."</p>

<p>"The crime is a great one," said Quincy. "But if the
poetry be good it may serve to mitigate your sentence.
Are those the evidences of your crime you hold in your
hand, Miss Pettingill?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, as she passed a written sheet to
him; "I wrote them before my eyes failed me. Perhaps
you will find it hard to read them. Which one is that?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"It is headed, 'On the Banks of the Tallahassee,'"
replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Alice, "I didn't write that song myself. A
gentleman friend, who is now dead, was the author of it.
But he couldn't write a chorus and he asked me to do it
for him. The idea of the chorus is moonlight on the river."</p>

<p>"Shall I read it?" asked Quincy.</p><p><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></p>

<p>"Only the chorus part, if you please," replied Alice, "and
be as lenient as you can, good Mr. Judge, for that was my
first offence."</p>

<p>Quincy, in a smooth, even voice, read the following
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moon's bright rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a silver maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fall on the rushing river;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each ray of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an arrow white<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drawn from a crystal quiver.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They romp and play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a wond'rous way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On tree and shrub and flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fill the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a radiant light,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That falls like a silver shower.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You do not say anything," said Alice, as Quincy finished
reading and remained silent.</p>

<p>He replied, "You have conferred judicial functions upon
me and a judge does not give his opinion until the evidence
is all in."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see," said Alice. "My knowledge of metrical
composition," she continued, "is very limited. What I
know of it I learned from an old copy of Fowler's Grammar
that I bought at Burnham's on School Street soon
after I went to Boston. I have always called what you
just read a poem. Is it one?" she asked, looking up with
a smile.</p>

<p>"I think it is," replied Quincy, "and," he added inadvertently,
"a very pretty one, too."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Judge," laughing outright "you have given
aid and comfort to the prisoner before the evidence was
all in."</p><p><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a></p>

<p>And Quincy was forced to laugh heartily at the acuteness
she had shown in forcing his opinion from him prematurely."</p>

<p>"Now, this one," said Alice, "I call a song. I know
which one it is by the size and thickness of the paper."
And she handed him a foolscap sheet.</p>

<p>Quincy took it and glanced over it a moment or two
before he spoke, Alice leaning forward and listening intently
for the first sound of his voice. Then Quincy uttered
those ever pleasing words, "Sweet, Sweet Home," and
delivered, with great expression, the words of the song.</p>

<p>"You read it splendidly," cried Alice, with evident delight.
"Would it be presuming on your kindness if I
asked you to read the refrain and chorus once more, Mr.
Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I shall enjoy reading it again myself," remarked
Quincy, as he proceeded to comply with Alice's pleasantly
worded request.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Of course you know that lovely song, 'Juanita'?" said
Alice.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Quincy, and he sang the first line of
the chorus.</p>

<p>Alice's voice joined in with his, and they finished the
chorus together. A thrill went through Quincy as he
sang the last line, and he was conscious that his voice quivered
when he came to the words, "Be my own fair bride."</p>

<p>"You sing with great expression," said Alice, "If you
like these new words that I have written to that old melody
we can sing them together. I have called it Loved Days.
I think this is the one," she said, as she passed him several
small sheets pinned together.</p>

<p>"It is," said Quincy, as he took the paper and read it
slowly.</p>

<p>As before, he said nothing when he had finished.</p>

<p>"Mr. Judge," said Alice, "would it be improper, from a
judicial point of view, for me to ask you which lines in the
song you have just read please you the most? But perhaps,"
said she, looking up at him, "none of them are
worthy of repetition."</p>

<p>"If you will consider for a moment," replied Quincy,
"that I am off the bench and am just sitting here quietly
with you, I will say, confidentially, that I am particularly
well pleased with this;" and he read a portion of the first
stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On Great Heaven's beauties,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gaze the eyes I loved to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done earth's weary duties,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, eternity.<br /></span>
</div></div><p><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a></p>

<p>"And," continued Quincy, "I think these lines from the
second stanza are fully equal to those I have just read."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But my soul, still living,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Speaks its words of comfort sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandest promise giving<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That again we'll meet.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I should think," continued Quincy, "that those words
were particularly well suited to be sung at a funeral. I
shall have to ask my friend Bradley to have his quartette
learn them, so as to be ready when I need them."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Sawyer," cried Alice, with a strong tone of
reproof in her voice, "how can you speak so lightly of
death?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," replied Quincy, "if I have unintentionally
wounded your feelings, but after all life is only precious
to those who have something to live for."</p>

<p>"But you certainly," said Alice, "can see something in
life worth living for."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Quincy, "I can see it, but I am not satisfied
in my own mind that I shall ever be able to possess
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you must work and wait and hope!" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to," he said, "if you will be kind and
say an encouraging word to me, so that I may not grow
weary of the battle of life."</p>

<p>"I should be pleased to help you all I can," she said
sweetly.</p>

<p>"I shall need your help," Quincy remarked gravely, and
then with a quick change in tone he said playfully, "I
think it is about time for the judge to get back upon the
bench."</p>

<p>"This," said Alice, as she passed him a manuscript
enclosed in a cover, "is my capital offence. If I escape punishment
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>for my other misdemeanors, I know I shall not
when you have read this." And she handed him the paper.</p>

<p>Quincy opened it and read, The Lord of the Sea, a
Cantata.</p>

<p>As he proceeded with the reading he became greatly
interested in it. He had a fine voice and had taken a prize
for oratory at Harvard.</p>

<p>When he finished he turned to Alice and said, "And you
wrote that?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said she. "Can you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Quincy said seriously, "Miss Pettengill, that is a fine
poem; it is grand when read, but it would be grander still
if set to music. I can imagine," Quincy continued, "how
those choruses would sound if sung by the Handel and
Haydn Society, backed up by a full orchestra and the big
organ." And he sang, to an extemporized melody of his
own, the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>"I can imagine," said he, as he rose and stood before
Alice, "King Canute as a heavy-voiced basso. How he
would bring out these words!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>As Quincy resumed his seat, Alice clapped her hands
to show her approbation of his oratorical effort. Then
they both sat in silence for a few minutes, each evidently
absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alice spoke:</p>

<p>"And now, Mr. Sawyer, will you let me ask you a serious
question? If I continue writing pieces like these, can I
hope to earn enough from it to support myself?"</p><p><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></p>

<p>Quincy thought for a moment, and then said, "I am
afraid not. If you would allow me to take them to Boston
the next time I go I will try and find out their market
value, but editors usually say that poetry is a drug, and
they have ten times as much offered them as they can find
room for. On the other hand, stories, especially short
ones, are eagerly sought and good prices paid for them.
Did you ever think of writing a story, Miss Pettengill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Alice, "I have several blocked out, I call
it, in my own mind, but it is such a task for me to write
that I dare not undertake them. If I could afford to pay
an amanuensis it would be different."</p>

<p>Quincy comprehended the situation in a moment. "I
like to write, Miss Pettengill," said he, "and time hangs
heavily upon my hands. We are likely to have a long
spell of winter weather, during which I shall be confined
to the house as well as yourself. Take pity on me and give
my idle hands something to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be too much to ask," said Alice.</p>

<p>"But you have not asked," answered Quincy. "I have
offered you my services without your asking."</p>

<p>"But when could we begin?" asked Alice, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"At once," replied Quincy. "I brought with me from
Boston a half ream of legal paper and a dozen good pencils.
I can write faster and much better with a pencil than
I can with a pen, and as all legal papers have to be copied,
I have got into the habit of using pencils for everything."</p>

<p>It took Quincy but a few minutes to go to his room and
secure his paper and pencils. He drew a table close to
Alice's chair and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>"What is the name of the story?" asked he.</p>

<p>Alice replied, "I have called it in my mind, 'How He Lost
Both Name and Fortune.'"</p><p><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></p>

<h3>A VISIT TO MRS. PUTNAM.<br /></h3>

<p>It must not be supposed that Alice's story was written
out by Quincy in one or even two days. The oldest
inhabitants will tell you that the great snowstorm lasted
three days and three nights, and it was not till the fourth
day thereafter that the roads were broken out, so that safe
travel between Eastborough Centre and Mason's Corner
became possible.</p>

<p>The day after the storm the sad intelligence came to
Quincy and Alice that old Mr. Putnam had passed quietly
away on the last day of the storm. Quincy attended the
funeral, and he could not help acknowledging to himself
that Lindy Putnam never looked more beautiful than in
her dress of plain black. The only ornament upon her
was a pair of beautiful diamond earrings, but she always
wore them, and consequently they were not obtrusive.</p>

<p>Quincy bore an urgent request from Mrs. Putnam that
Alice should come to see her. As the story was finished
and copied on the seventh day after the storm, Quincy had
the old-fashioned sleigh brought out and lined with robes.
Taking the horse Old Bill, that sleigh bells or snow slides
could not startle from his equanimity, Alice was driven to
Mrs. Putnam's, and in a few minutes was clasped to Mrs.
Putnam's bosom, the old lady crying and laughing by turns.</p>

<p>Quincy thought it best, to leave them alone, and descending
the stairs he entered the parlor, the door being halfway
open. He started back as he saw a form dressed in black,
seated by the window.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Sawyer," said Lindy. "I knew you were
<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>here. I saw you when you drove up with Miss Pettengill.
What a beautiful girl she is, and what a pity that she is
blind. I hope with all my heart that she will recover her
sight."</p>

<p>"She would be pleased to hear you say that," remarked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"We were never intimate," said Lindy. "You can tell
her from me, you are quite the gallant chevalier, Mr. Sawyer,
and what you say to her will sound sweeter than if it
came from other lips. Are you going to marry her, Mr.
Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I do not think that our acquaintance is of such long
standing that you are warranted in asking me so personal
a question," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Lindy, "but as I happened to know,
though not from your telling, that she is to be my mother's
heiress, I had a little curiosity to learn whether you had
already proposed or were going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Putnam," said Quincy sternly, "do not complete
your sentence. Do not make me think worse of you than
I already do. I beg your pardon for intruding upon you.
I certainly should not have done so had I anticipated such
an interview."</p>

<p>Lindy burst into a flood of tears. Her grief seemed uncontrollable.
Quincy closed the parlor door, thinking that
if her cries and sobs were heard upstairs it would require
a double explanation, which it might be hard for him to
give.</p>

<p>He stood and looked at the weeping girl. She had evidently
known all along who her mother's heiress was. She
had been fooling him, but for what reason? Was she in
love with him? No, he did not think so; if she had been
she would have confided in him rather than have sought
to force him to confide in her. What could be the motive
for her action? Quincy was nonplussed. He had had
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>considerable experience with society girls, but they either
relied upon languid grace or light repartee. They never
used tears either for offence or defence.</p>

<p>A surprise was in store for Quincy. Lindy rose from
her chair and came towards him, her eyes red with weeping.</p>

<p>"Why do you hate me so, Mr. Sawyer?" she asked.
"Why will you not be a friend to me, when I need one so
much? What first turned you against me?"</p>

<p>Quincy replied, "I will tell you, Miss Putnam. They told
me you were ashamed of your father and mother because
they were old-fashioned country people and did not dress
as well or talk as good English as you did."</p>

<p>"Who told you so?" asked Lindy.</p>

<p>"It was common talk in the village," he replied.</p>

<p>"I should think you had suffered enough from village
gossip, Mr. Sawyer, not to believe that all that is said is
true."</p>

<p>Quincy winced and colored. It was a keen thrust and
went home.</p>

<p>"Where there is so much smoke there must be some
fire," he answered, rather lamely, as he thought, even to
himself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer, when I asked you to tell me a little secret
you had in your possession, you refused. I wanted a
friend, but I also wanted a proven friend. No doubt I
took the wrong way to win your friendship, but I am going
to tell you something, Mr. Sawyer, if you will listen to
me, that will at least secure your pity for one who is rich
in wealth but poor in that she has no friends to whom she
can confide her troubles."</p>

<p>Quincy saw that he was in for it, and like a gentleman,
determined to make the best of it, so he said, "Miss Putnam,
I will listen to your story, and if, after hearing it, I
can honorably aid you I will do so with pleasure."</p><p><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></p>

<p>Lindy took his hand, which he had half extended, and
said, "Come, sit down, Mr. Sawyer. It is a long story,
and I am nervous and tired," and she looked down at her
black dress.</p>

<p>They sat upon the sofa, he at one end, she at the other.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer," she began abruptly, "I am not a natural-born
child of Mr. and Mrs. Putnam. I was adopted by
them when but two years of age. I do not know who my
father and mother were. I am sure Mrs. Putnam knows,
but she will not tell me."</p>

<p>"It could do no harm now that you are a woman grown,"
said Quincy.</p>

<p>"At first they both loved me," Lindy continued, "but a
year after I came here to live their son was born, and from
that time on all was changed. Mr. Putnam was never
unkind to me but once, but Mrs. Putnam seemed to take
delight in blaming me, and tormenting me, and nagging
me, until it is a wonder that my disposition is as good as it
is, and you know it is not very good," said she to Quincy
with a little smile. She resumed her story: "I loved the
little boy, Jones I always called him, and as we grew up
together he learned to love me and took my part, although
he was three years younger than myself. This fact made
Mrs. Putnam hate me more than ever. He stayed at home
until he was twenty-two, then he went to his father and
mother and told them that he loved me and wished to marry
me. Both Mr. and Mrs. Putnam flew into a great rage at
this. The idea of a brother marrying his sister! They said
it was a crime and a sacrilege, and the vengeance of God
would surely fall upon us both. Jones told them he had
written to a lawyer in Boston, and he had replied that there
was no law prohibiting such a marriage. 'But the law of
God shines before you like a flaming sword,' said Mrs.
Putnam; and Mr. Putnam agreed with her, for she had all
his property in her possession." Quincy smiled. "They
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>packed Jones off to the city at once," said Lindy, "and his
mother gave him five thousand dollars to go into business
with. Jones began speculating, and he was successful from
first to last. In three months he paid back the five thousand
dollars his mother had given him, and he never took
a dollar from them after that day. At twenty-six he was
worth one hundred thousand dollars. When I went to Boston
I always saw him, and he at last told me he could stand
it no longer. Be wanted me to marry him and go to
Europe with him. I told him I must have a week to think
it over. If I decided to go I would be in Boston on a certain
day. I would bring my trunk and would stop at a
certain hotel and send word for him to come to me. I used
all possible secrecy in getting my clothes ready, and packed
them away, as I thought, unnoticed, in my trunk, which was
in the attic. Mrs. Putnam must have suspected that I
intended to leave home, and she knew that I would not go
unless to meet her son. The day before I planned going to
Boston, or rather the night before, she entered my room
while I was asleep, took every particle of my clothing, with
the exception of one house dress and a pair of slippers,
and locked me in. They kept me there for a week, and I
wished that I had died there, for when they came to me it
was to tell me that Jones was dead, and I was the cause
of it. I who loved him so!" And the girl's eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"What was the cause of his death?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"He was young, healthy, and careless," answered Lindy.
"He took a bad cold and it developed into lung fever.
Even then he claimed it was nothing and would not see a
doctor. One morning he did not come to the office, his
clerk went to his room, but when the doctor was called it
was too late. It was very sad that he should die so, believing
that I had refused to go with him, when I would have
given my life for him. He loved me till death. He left
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>me all his money, but in his will he expressed the wish that
I would never accept a dollar from his parents. So now
you see why Mrs. Putnam does not make me her heiress.
You think I hate Miss Pettengill because she is going to
give it to her, but truly I do not, Mr. Sawyer. What I
said when you came in I really meant, and I hope you will
be happy, Mr. Sawyer, even as I hoped to be years ago."</p>

<p>Quincy had been greatly interested in Lindy's story, and
that feeling of sympathy for the unhappy and suffering
that always shows itself in a true gentleman rose strongly
in his breast.</p>

<p>"Miss Putnam," said he, "I have wronged you both in
thought and action, but I never suspected what you have
told me. Will you forgive me and allow me to be your
friend? I will try to atone in the future for my misdoings
in the past."</p>

<p>He extended his hand, and Lindy laid hers in his.</p>

<p>"I care not for the past," said she. "I will forget that. I
have also to ask for forgiveness. I, too, have said and done
many things which I would not have said or done, but for
womanly spite and vanity. You see my excuse is not so
good as yours," said she, as she smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>"In what way can I serve you?" asked Quincy. "Why
do you not go to Boston and live? I could introduce you
to many pleasant families."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Lindy. "Me, a waif and a stray! You
are too kind-hearted, Mr. Sawyer. I shall not leave the
woman every one but you thinks to be my mother. When
she is dead I shall leave Eastborough never to return. My
sole object in life from that day will be to find some trace
of my parents or relatives. Now it may happen that
through Mrs. Putnam or Miss Pettengill you may get
some clew that will help me in my search. It is for this
that I wish a friend, and I have a presentiment that some
day you will be able to help me."</p><p><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a></p>

<p>Quincy assured her that if it lay in his power any time
to be of assistance to her, she could count upon him.</p>

<p>"By the way, Miss Putnam," said he, "how did your investment
with Foss &amp; Follansbee turn out? I heard a
rumor that the stock fell, and you lost considerable
money."</p>

<p>Lindy flushed painfully. "It did drop, Mr. Sawyer, but
it rallied again, as you call it, and when they sold out for me
I made nearly five thousand dollars; but," and she looked
pleadingly up into Quincy's face, "you have forgiven me
for that as well as for my other wrong doings."</p>

<p>"For everything up to date," said Quincy, laughing.</p>

<p>At that instant a loud pounding was heard on the floor
above.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Putnam is knocking for you," said Lindy. "Miss
Pettengill must be ready to go home. Good-by, Mr. Sawyer,
and do not forget your unhappy friend."</p>

<p>"I promise to remember her and her quest," said Quincy.</p>

<p>He gave the little hand extended to him, a slight pressure
and ran up the stairs. As he did so he heard the parlor
door close behind him.</p>

<p>As they were driving home, Alice several times took what
appeared to be a letter from her muff and held it up as
though trying to read it. Quincy glanced towards her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer, can you keep a secret?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I have a big one on my mind now," replied Quincy,
"that I would like to confide to some one."</p>

<p>"Why don't you?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"As soon as I can find a person whom I think can fully
sympathize with me I shall do so, but for the present I
must bear my burden in silence," said he.</p>

<p>"I hope you Will not have to wait long before finding
that sympathetic friend," remarked Alice.</p>

<p>"I hope so, too," he replied. "But I have not answered
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>your question, Miss Pettengill. If I can serve you by
storing a secret with you, it shall be safe with me."</p>

<p>"Will you promise not to speak of it, not even to me?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"If you wish it I will promise," he answered.</p>

<p>"Then please read to me what is written on that
envelope."</p>

<p>Quincy looked at the envelope. "It is written in an old-fashioned,
cramped hand," he said, "and the writing is 'confided
to Miss Alice Pettengill, and to be destroyed without
being read by her within twenty-four hours after my death.
Hepsibeth Putnam.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Alice simply, and she replaced the
envelope in her muff.</p>

<p>Like a flash of lightning the thought came to Quincy
that the letter to be destroyed had some connection with
the strange story so recently told him by Lindy. He must
take some action in the matter before it was too late.
Turning to Alice he said, "Miss Pettengill, if I make a
strange request of you, which you can easily grant, will you
do it, and not ask me for any explanation until after you
have complied?"</p>

<p>"You have worded your inquiry so carefully, Mr. Sawyer,
that I am a little afraid you, you being a lawyer, but as
you have so graciously consented to keep a secret with me,
I will trust you and will promise to comply with your
request."</p>

<p>"All I ask is," said Quincy, "that before you destroy that
letter, you will let me read to you once more what is written
upon the envelope."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said Alice, "how could I refuse so
harmless a request as that?"</p>

<p>"I am greatly obliged for your kindness," said Quincy
to her; but he thought to himself, "I will find out what is
in that envelope, if there is any honorable way of doing so."</p><p><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a></p>

<p>Hiram came over to see Mandy that evening, and Mrs.
Crowley, who was in the best of spirits, sang several old-time
Irish songs to them, Hiram and Mandy joining in the
choruses. They were roasting big red apples on the top of
the stove and chestnuts in the oven. Quincy, attracted by
the singing, came downstairs to the kitchen, and was invited
to join in the simple feast. He then asked Mrs. Crowley to
sing for him, which she did, and he repaid her by singing,
"The Harp That Once Thro' Tara's Halls" so sweetly that
tears coursed down the old woman's cheeks, and she said,
"My poor boy Tom, that was killed in the charge at Balaklava,
used to sing just like that."</p>

<p>Then the poor woman began weeping so violently that
Mandy coaxed her off to bed and left the room with her.</p>

<p>When Hiram and Quincy were alone together, the latter
said: "Any news, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied Hiram. "The snow is too deep, and
it's too darned cold for the boys to travel 'round and do
much gossipin' this weather. A notice is pasted up on Hill's
grocery that it'll be sold by auction next Tuesday at three
o'clock in the afternoon. And I got on to one bit of news.
Strout and his friends are goin' to give Huldy Mason a surprise
party. They have invited me and Mandy simply because
they want you to hear all about it. But they don't
propose to invite you, nor 'Zeke, nor his sister."</p>

<p>"Has Strout got anybody to back him up on buying the
grocery store?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hiram, "he has got two thousand dollars
pledged, and I hear he wants five hundred dollars more.
He don't think the whole thing will run over twenty-five
hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"How much is to be paid in cash?" Quincy inquired.</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars," said Hiram; "and that's what
troubles Strout. His friends will endorse his notes and
take a mortgage on the store, for they know it's a good<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>payin' business. They expect to get their money back with
good interest, but it comes kinder hard on them to plunk
down five hundred dollars in cold cash."</p>

<p>At that moment Mandy returned, and after asking her
for a spoon and a plate upon which to take a roast apple and
some chestnuts upstairs, Quincy left the young couple
together. As he sat before the fire enjoying his lunch, he
resolved that he would buy that grocery store, cost what it
might, and that 'Zeke Pettengill, Alice, and himself would
go to that surprise party.</p><p><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a></p>

<h3>THE NEW DOCTOR.<br /></h3>

<p>Quincy improved the first opportunity offered for
safe travelling to make a visit to the city. He had
several matters to attend to. First, he had not sent his
letter to his friend, requesting him to make inquiries as to
Obadiah Strout's war record, for the great snowstorm had
come the day after he had written it. Second, he was going
to take Alice's story to show to a literary friend, and see if
he could secure its publication. And this was not all; Alice
had told him, after he had finished copying the story she
had dictated to him, that she had written several other short
stories during the past two years.</p>

<p>In response to his urgent request, she allowed him to
read her treasured manuscripts. The first was a passionate
love story in which a young Spanish officer, stationed on
the island of Cuba, and a beautiful young Cuban girl were
the principals. It was entitled "Her Native Land," and
was replete with startling situations and effective tableaus.
Quincy was delighted with it, and told Alice if dramatized
it would make a fine acting play. This was, of course, very
pleasing to the young author. Quincy was her amanuensis,
her audience, and her critic, and she knew that in his eyes
she was already a success.</p>

<p>She also gave him to read a series of eight stories, in a
line usually esteemed quite foreign to feminine instincts.
Alice had conceived the idea of a young man, physically
weak and suffering from nervous debility, being left an
immense fortune at the age of twenty-one. His money was
well invested, and in company with a faithful attendant he
travelled for fifteen years, covering every nook and corner
<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>of the habitable globe. At thirty-six he returned home
much improved in health, but still having a marked aversion
to engaging in any business pursuit. A mysterious case
and its solution having been related to him, he resolved to
devote his income, now amounting to a million dollars
yearly, to amateur detective work. His great-desire was
to ferret out and solve mysteries, murders, suicides, robberies,
and disappearances that baffled the police and
eluded their vigilant inquiry.</p>

<p>The titles that Alice had chosen for her stories were as
mysterious, in their way, as the stories themselves. Arranged
in the order of their writing, they were: Was it
Signed? The Man Without a Tongue; He Thought He
Was Dead; The Eight of Spades; The Exit of Mrs. Delmonnay;
How I Caught the Fire-Bugs; The Hot Hand;
and The Mystery of Unreachable Island.</p>

<p>When Quincy reached the city, his first visit was to his
father's office, but he found him absent. He was told that
he was conducting a case in the Equity Session of the
Supreme Court, and would not return to the office that
day.</p>

<p>Instead of leaving his letter at his friend's office, he went
directly to the Adjutant-General's office at the State House.
Here he found that an acquaintance of his was employed
as a clerk. He was of foreign birth, but had served gallantly
through the war and had left an arm upon the battlefield.
He made his request for a copy of the war record of
Obadiah Strout, of the &mdash;th Mass. Volunteers. Then a
thought came suddenly to him and he requested one also
of the record of Hiram Maxwell of the same regiment.</p>

<p>Leaving the State House on the Hancock Avenue side,
he walked down that narrow but convenient thoroughfare,
and was standing at its entrance to the sidewalk on Beacon
Street, debating which publisher he would call on first,
when a cheery voice said, "Hello, Sawyer." When he
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>looked up he saw an old Latin School and college chum,
named Leopold Ernst. Ernst was a Jew, but he had been
one of the smartest and most popular of the boys in school
and of the men at Harvard.</p>

<p>"What are you up to?" asked Ernst.</p>

<p>"Living on my small fortune and my father's bounty,"
said Quincy. "Not a very creditable record, I know, but
my health has not been very good, and I have been resting
for a couple of months in the country."</p>

<p>"Not much going on in the country at this time of the
year I fancy," remarked Ernst.</p>

<p>"That's where you are wrong," said Quincy. "There
has been the devil to pay ever since I landed in the town,
and I've got mixed up in so many complications that I don't
expect to get back to town before next Christmas. But
what are you doing, Ernst?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am in for literature; not the kind that consists in
going round with a notebook and prying into people's business,
with a hope one day of becoming an editor, and working
twenty hours out of the twenty-four each day. Not a
bit of it, I am reader for&mdash;&mdash;;" and he mentioned the name
of a large publishing house. "I have my own hours and a
comfortable salary. I sit like Solomon upon the efforts
of callow authors and the productions of ripened genius.
Sometimes I discover a diamond in the rough, and introduce
a new star to the literary firmament; and at other times I
cut up some egotistical old writer, who thinks anything he
turns out will be sure to please the public."</p>

<p>"How fortunate that I have met you?" said Quincy.
"I have in this little carpet bag the first effusions of one of
those callow authors of whom you spoke. She is poor,
beautiful, and blind."</p>

<p>"Don't try to trade on my sympathies, old boy," said
Ernst. "No person who is poor has any right to become
an author. It takes too long in these days to make a hit,
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>and the poor author is bound to die before the hit comes.
The 'beautiful' gag don't work with me at all. The best
authors are homelier than sin and it's a pity that their pictures
are ever published. As regards the 'blind' part, that
may be an advantage, for dictating relieves one of the
drudgery of writing one's self, and gives one a chance for
a fuller play of one's fancies than if tied to a piece of wood,
a scratchy pen, and a bottle of thick ink."</p>

<p>"Then you won't look at them," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I didn't say so," replied Ernst. "Of course, I can't
look at them in a business way, unless they are duly submitted
to my house, but I have been reading a very badly
written, but mightily interesting manuscript, for the past
two days and a half, and I want a change of work or diversion,
to brush up my wits. Now, old fellow," said he, taking
Quincy by the arm, "if you will come up to the club with
me, and have a good dinner with some Chianti, and a glass
or two of champagne, and a pousse cafe to finish up with,
then we will go up to my rooms on Chestnut Street&mdash;I have
a whole top floor to myself&mdash;we will light up our cigars,
and you may read to me till to-morrow morning and I
won't murmur. But, mind you, if the stories are mighty
poor I may go to sleep, and if I do that, you might as well
go to bed too, for when I once go to sleep I never wake
up till I get good and ready."</p>

<p>Quincy had intended after seeing a publisher to leave the
manuscripts for examination, then to take tea with his
mother and sisters, and go back to Eastborough on the
five minutes past six express. But he was prone to yield to
fate, which is simply circumstances, and he accepted his old
college chum's invitation with alacrity. He could get the
opinion of an expert speedily, and that fact carried the day
with him.</p>

<p>When they were comfortably ensconced in their easy-chairs
on the top floor, and the cigars lighted, Quincy commenced
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>reading. Leopold had previously shown him his
suite, which consisted of a parlor, or rather a sitting-room, a
library, which included principally the works of standard
authors and reference books, his sleeping apartment, and
a bathroom.</p>

<p>There was a large bed lounge in the sitting-room, and
Quincy determined to read every story in his carpet bag,
if it took him all night. He commenced with the series of
detective or mystery stories. He had read them over before
and was able to bring out their strong points oratorically,
for, as it has been said before, he was a fine speaker.</p>

<p>Quincy eyed Ernst over the corner of the manuscript he
was reading, but the latter understood his business. Occasionally
he was betrayed into a nod of approval and several
times shook his head in a negative way, but he uttered no
word of commendation or disapproval.</p>

<p>After several of the stories had been read, Ernst called
a halt, and going to a cupboard brought out some crackers,
cake, and a decanter of wine, with glasses, which he put
upon a table, and placed within comfortable reach of both
reader and listener. Then he said, "Go ahead," munched
a cracker, sipped his wine, and then lighted a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>When the series was finished, Leopold said, "Now we
will have some tea. I do a good deal of my reading at
home, and I don't like to go out again after I have crawled
up four flights of stairs, so my landlady sends me up a
light supper at just about this hour. There is the maid
now," as a light knock was heard on the door.</p>

<p>Leopold opened it, and the domestic brought in a tray
with a pot of tea and the ingredients of a light repast,
which she placed upon another table near a window.</p>

<p>"There is always enough for two," said Leopold. "Reading
is mighty tiresome work, and listening is too, and a cup
of good strong tea will brighten us both up immensely.<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>
You can come back for the tray in fifteen minutes, Jennie,"
said Ernest.</p>

<p>The supper was finished, the tray removed, and the critic
sat in judgment once more upon the words that fell from
the reader's lips. Leopold's face lighted up during the
reading of "Her Native Land." He started to speak, and
the word "That's&mdash;" escaped him, but he recovered himself
and said no more, though he listened intently.</p>

<p>Quincy took a glass of wine and a cracker before starting
upon the story which had been dictated to him. Leopold
gave no sign of falling asleep, but patted his hands
lightly together at certain points in the story, whether
contemplatively or approvingly Quincy could not determine.
As he read the closing lines of the last manuscript
the cuckoo clock struck twelve, midnight.</p>

<p>"You are a mighty good reader, Quincy," said Leopold,
"and barring fifteen minutes for refreshments, you
have been at it ten hours. Now you want my opinion of
those stories, and what's more, you want my advice as to
the best place to put them to secure their approval and
early publication. Now I am going to smoke a cigar quietly
and think the whole thing over, and at half past twelve I
will give you my opinion in writing. I am going into my
library for half an hour to write down what I have to say.
You take a nap on the lounge there, and you will be refreshed
when I come back after having made mince meat
of your poor, beautiful, blind <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>Leopold disappeared into the library, and Quincy
stretching himself on the lounge, rested, but did not sleep.
Before he had realized that ten minutes had passed, Leopold
stood beside him with a letter sheet in his hand, and said,
"Now, Quincy, read this to me, and I will see if I have
got it down straight."</p>

<p>Quincy's hand trembled nervously as he seated himself
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>in his old position and turning the sheet so that the light
would fall upon it, he read the following:</p>

<p>Opinion of Leopold Ernst, Literary Critic, of certain
manuscripts submitted for examination by Quincy A. Sawyer,
with some advice gratis.</p>

<p>1. Series of eight stories. Mighty clever general idea;
good stories well written. Same style maintained throughout;
good plots. Our house could not handle them&mdash;not
of our line. Send to&mdash;&mdash;. (Here followed the name of a
New York publisher.) I will write Cooper, one of their
readers. He is a friend of mine, and will secure quick decision,
which, I prophesy, will be favorable.</p>

<p>2. "Her Native Land" is a fine story. I can get it into a
weekly literary paper that our house publishes. I know
Jameson, the reader, will take it, especially if you would
give him the right to dramatize it. He is hand and glove
with all the theatre managers and has had several successes.</p>

<p>3. That story about the Duke, I want for our magazine.
It is capital, and has enough meat in it to make a full-blown
novel. All it wants is oysters, soup, fish, entrees, and a
dessert prefixed to and joined on to the solid roast and
game which the story as now written itself supplies.</p>

<p>In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, this
24th day of February, 186&mdash;.</p>

<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Leopold Ernst</span>, Literary Critic.</p>

<p>Quincy remained all night with Leopold, sleeping on the
bed lounge in the sitting-room. He was up at six o'clock
the next morning, but found that his friend was also an early
riser, for on entering the library he saw the latter seated
at his desk regarding the pile of manuscript which Quincy
had read to him.</p>

<p>Leopold looked up with a peculiar expression on his face.</p>

<p>"What's the matter," asked Quincy, "changing your
mind?"</p><p><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a></p>

<p>"No," said Leopold, "I never do that, it would spoil my
value as a reader if I did. My decisions are as fixed as
the laws of the Medes and Persians, and are regarded by
literary aspirants as being quite as severe as the statutes of
Draco; but the fact is, Quincy, you and your <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>&mdash;you
see I consider you equally culpable&mdash;have neglected to
put any real name or pseudonym to these interesting stories.
Of course I can affix the name of the most popular author
that the world has ever known,&mdash;Mr. Anonymous,&mdash;but you
two probably have some pet name that you wish immortalized."</p>

<p>"By George!" cried Quincy, "we did forget that. I will
talk it over with her, and send you the <i>nom de plume</i> by
mail.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Leopold, rising. "And now let us go
and have some breakfast."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you must excuse me. I have not seen
my parents this trip, and I ought to go up to the house and
take breakfast with the family."</p>

<p>"All right," said Leopold, "rush that pseudonym right
along, so I can send the manuscripts to Cooper. And don't
forget to drop in and see me next time you come to the
city."</p>

<p>On his way to Beacon Street Quincy suddenly stopped
and regarded a sign that read, Paul Culver, M.D., physician
and surgeon. He knew Culver, but hadn't seen him for
eight years. They were in the Latin School together under
<i>pater</i> Gardner. He rang the bell and was shown into Dr.
Culver's office, and in a few minutes his old schoolmate entered.
Paul Culver was a tall, broad-chested, heavily-built
young man, with frank blue eyes, and hair of the color that
is sometimes irreverently called, or rather the wearers of
it are called, towheads.</p>

<p>They had a pleasant talk over old school days and college
experiences, which were not identical, for Paul had graduated
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>from Yale College at his father's desire, instead of
from Harvard. Then Quincy broached what was upper-most
in his mind and which had been the real reason for
his call. He stated briefly the facts concerning Alice's case,
and asked Paul's advice.</p>

<p>Dr. Culver salt for a few moments apparently in deep
study.</p>

<p>"My advice," said he, "is to see Tillotson. He has an
office in the Hotel Pelham, up by the Public Library, you
know."</p>

<p>"Is he a 'regular'?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," said Culver, "I don't think he is. For a fact I
know he is not an M.D., but I fancy that the diploma that
be holds from the Almighty is worth more to suffering
humanity than a good many issued by the colleges."</p>

<p>"You are a pretty broad-minded allopath," said Quincy,
"to give such a sweeping recommendation to a quack."</p>

<p>"I didn't say he was a quack," replied Culver. "He is a
natural-born healer, and he uses only nature's remedies in
his practice. Go and see him, Quincy, and judge for yourself."</p>

<p>"But," said Quincy, "I had hoped that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I couldn't," broke in Paul. "I am an emergency
doctor. If baby has the croup, or Jimmy has the measles, or
father has the lung fever, they call me in, and I get them
well as soon as possible. But if mother-in-law has some
obscure complaint I am too busy to give the time to study
it up, and they wouldn't pay me for it if I did. Medicine,
like a great many other things, is going into the hands of
the specialists eventually, and Tillotson is one of the first of
the new school."</p>

<p>At that moment a maid announced that some one wished
to see Dr. Culver, and Quincy took a hurried leave.</p>

<p>He found his father, mother, and sisters at home, and
breakfast was quickly served after his arrival. They all
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>said he was looking much better, and all asked him when
he was coming home. He gave an evasive answer, saying
that there were lots of good times coming down in Eastborough
and he didn't wish to miss them. He told his
father he was improving his time reading and writing, and
would give a good account of himself when he did return.</p>

<p>He had to wait an hour before he could secure an interview
with Dr. Tillotson. The latter had a spare day in each
week, that day being Thursday, which he devoted to cases
that he was obliged to visit personally. Quincy arranged
with him to visit Eastborough on the following Thursday,
and by calling a carriage managed to catch the half-past
eleven train for that town, and reached his boarding place
a little before two o'clock. He had arranged with the driver
to wait for a letter that he wished to have mailed to Boston
that same afternoon.</p>

<p>He went in by the back door, and as he passed through
the kitchen, Mandy made a sign, and he went to her.</p>

<p>"Hiram waited till one o'clock," said she, "but he had to
go home, and he wanted me to tell you that the surprise
party is coming off next Monday night, and they are going
to get there at seven o'clock, so as to have plenty of time
for lots of fun, and Hiram suspects," and her voice fell to a
whisper, "that Strout is going to try and work the Deacon
for that five hundred in cash to put up for the grocery store
next Tuesday. That's all," said she.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Pettengill?" Quincy inquired.</p>

<p>"She's in the parlor," said Mandy. "She has been playing
the piano and singing beautifully, but I guess she has
got tired."</p>

<p>Quincy went directly to the parlor and found Alice seated
before the open fire, her right hand covering her eyes.</p>

<p>She, looked up as Quincy entered the room and said, "I
am so glad you've got back, Mr. Sawyer. I have been very
lonesome since you have been away."</p><p><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a></p>

<p>Alice did not see the happy smile that spread over
Quincy's face, and he covered up his pleasure by saying,
"How did you know it was I?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Alice, "my hearing is very acute. I know
the step of every person in the house. Swiss has been with
me all the morning, but he asked a few minutes ago to be
excused, so he could get his dinner."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed, and then, said, "Miss Pettengill, we forgot
a very important matter in connection with your stories;
we omitted to put on the name of the author." He told her
of his meeting with Ernst, and what had taken place, and
Alice was delighted. Quincy did not refer to the coming
visit of Dr. Tillotson, for he did not mean to speak of it
until the day appointed arrived. "Now, Miss Pettengill,
I have some letters to write to send back by the hotel carriage,
so that they can be mailed this afternoon. While I
am doing this you can decide upon your pseudonym, and I
will put it in the letter that I am going to write to Ernst."</p>

<p>Quincy went up to his room and sat down at his writing
table. The first letter was to his bankers, and enclosed a
check for five hundred dollars, with a request to send the
amount in bills by Adams Express to Eastborough Centre,
to reach there not later than noon of the next Tuesday,
and to be held until called for. The second letter was to a
prominent confectioner and caterer in Boston, ordering
enough ice cream, sherbet, frozen pudding, and assorted
cake for a party of fifty persons, and fifty grab-bag presents;
all to reach Eastborough Centre in good order on Monday
night on the five minutes past six express from Boston.
The third letter was to Ernst. It was short and to the point.
"The pseudonym is&mdash;." And he left a blank space for the
name. Then he signed his own. He glanced over his writing
table and saw the three poems that Alice had given him
to read. He added a postscript to his letter to Ernst. It
read as follows:</p><p><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a></p>

<p>
"I enclose three poems written by the same person who
wrote the stories. Tell me what you think of them, and if
you can place them anywhere do so, and this shall be your
warrant therefor.
</p>
<p class="right1">Q.A.S."</p>

<p>When his mail was in readiness he went downstairs to the
parlor, taking a pen and bottle of ink with him, and saying
to himself, "That pseudonym shall not be written in pencil."</p>

<p>"I am in a state of hopeless indecision," remarked Alice.
"I can think of Christian names that please me, and surnames
that please me, but when I put them together they
don't please me at all."</p>

<p>"Then we will leave it to fate," said Quincy. He tore a
sheet of paper into six pieces and passed three, with a book
and pencil, to Alice. "Now you write," said he, "three
Christian names that please you, and I will write three
surnames that please me; then we will put the pieces in
my hat, and you will select two and what you select shall
be the name."</p>

<p>"That's a capital idea," said Alice, "it is harder to select
a name than it was to write the story."</p>

<p>The slips were written, placed in the hat, shaken up, and
Alice selected two, which she held up for Quincy to read.</p>

<p>"This is not fair," said Quincy. "I never thought. Both
of the slips are mine. We must try again."</p>

<p>"No," said Alice, "it is 'Kismet.' What are the names?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Bruce Douglas, or Douglas Bruce, as you prefer," said
Quincy.</p>

<p>"I like Bruce Douglas best," replied Alice.</p>

<p>"I am so glad," said Quincy, "that's the name I should
have selected myself."</p>

<p>"Then I will bear your name in future," said Alice, and
Quincy thought to himself that he wished she had said
those words in response to a question that was in his mind,
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>but which he had decided it was not yet time to ask her.
He was too much of a gentleman to refer in a joking manner
to the words which Alice had spoken and which had
been uttered with no thought or idea that they bore a
double meaning.</p>

<p>Quincy wrote the selected name in the blank space in
Leopold's letter, sealed it and took his mail out to the carriage
driver, who was seated in the kitchen enjoying a
piece of mince pie and a mug of cider which Mandy had
given him.</p>

<p>As Quincy entered the kitchen he heard Mandy say,
"How is 'Bias nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dad's all right," said the young man; "he is going
to run Wallace Stackpole again for tax collector against
Obadiah Strout."</p>

<p>"Is your name Smith?" asked Quincy, advancing with
the letters in his hand.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the young man, "my name is Abbott
Smith. My dad's name is 'Bias; he is pretty well known
'round these parts."</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," said Quincy, "and I wish to see
him and Mr. Stackpole together. Can you come over for
me next Wednesday morning and bring Mr. Stackpole
with you? I can talk to him going back, and I want you
to drive us over to your father's place. Don't say anything
about it except to Mr. Stackpole and your father, but I am
going to take a hand in town politics this year."</p>

<p>The young man laughed and said, "I will be over here
by eight o'clock next Wednesday."</p>

<p>"I wish you would have these letters weighed at the
post office, and if any more stamps are needed please put
them on. Take what is left for your trouble," and Quincy
passed Abbott a half dollar.</p>

<p>He heard the retreating carriage wheels as he went upstairs
to his room. He made an entry in his pocket diary,
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>and then ran his eye over several others that preceded and
followed it.</p>

<p>"Let me see," soliloquized he, as he read aloud, "this is
Friday; Saturday, expect war records from Adjutant-General;
Monday, hear from Ernst, surprise party in the
evening; Tuesday, get money at express office; Tuesday
afternoon, buy Hill's grocery and give Strout his first
knock-out; Wednesday, see Stackpole and Smith and arrange
to knock Strout out again; Thursday, Dr. Tillotson."
He laughed and closed the book. Then he said, "And the
city fellows think it must be dull down here because there
is nothing going on in a country town in the winter."</p><p><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>SOME PLAIN FACTS AND INFERENCES.<br /></h3>

<p>The next day was Saturday; the sun did not show itself
from behind the clouds till noon, and Quincy put off
his trip to the Eastborough Centre post office with the hope
that the afternoon would be pleasant. His wish was gratified,
and at dinner he said he was going to drive over to
Eastborough Centre, and asked Miss Pettengill if she would
not like to accompany him. Alice hesitated, but Uncle Ike
advised her to go, telling her that she stayed indoors too
much and needed outdoor exercise. Ezekiel agreed with
his uncle, and Alice finally gave what seemed to Quincy to
be a somewhat reluctant consent.</p>

<p>He saw that the sleigh was amply supplied with robes,
and Mandy, at his suggestion, heated a large piece of soap-stone,
which was wrapped up and placed in the bottom of
the sleigh.</p>

<p>Alice appeared at the door equipped for her journey.
Always lovely in Quincy's eyes, she appeared still more
so in her suit of dark blue cloth. Over her shoulders she
wore a fur cape lined with quilted red satin, and on her head
a fur cap, which made a strong contract with her light hair
which crept out in little curls from underneath.</p>

<p>They started off at a smart speed, for Old Bill was not
in the shafts this time. Alice had been familiar with the
road to Eastborough before leaving home, and as Quincy
described the various points they passed, Alice entered into
the spirit of the drive with all the interest and enthusiasm
of a child. The sharp winter air brought a rosy bloom to
her cheeks, and as Quincy looked at those wonderful large
blue eyes, he could hardly make himself believe that they
<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>could not see him. He was sure he had never seen a
handsomer girl.</p>

<p>As they passed Uncle Ike's little house, Quincy called
her attention to it. Alice said:</p>

<p>"Poor Uncle Ike, I wish I could do more for him, he
has done so much for me. He paid for my lessons in bookkeeping
and music, and also for my board until I had finished
my studies and obtained a position. He has been a
father to me since my own dear father died."</p>

<p>Quincy felt some inclination to find out the real reason
why Uncle Ike had left his family, but he repressed it and
called attention to some trees, heavily coated with snow
and ice, which looked beautiful in the sunshine, and he described
them so graphically, bringing in allusions to pearls
and diamonds and strings of glistening jewels, that Alice
clapped her hands in delight and said she would take him
as her literary partner, to write in the descriptive passages.
Quincy for an instant felt impelled to take advantage of
the situation, but saying to himself, "The time is not yet,"
he touched the horse with his whip and for half a minute
was obliged to give it his undivided attention.</p>

<p>"Did you think the horse was running away?" said he
to Alice, when he had brought him down to a trot. "Were
you afraid?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid of nothing nowadays," she replied. "I
trust my companions implicitly, knowing that they will tell
me if I am in danger and advise me what to do. I had a
debate a long time ago with Uncle Ike about blind people
and deaf people. He said he would rather be stone deaf
than blind. As he argued it, the deaf person could read and
write and get along very comfortably by himself. I argued
on the other side. I wish to hear the voices of my friends
when they talk and sing and read, and then, you know,
everybody lends a helping hand to a person who is blind,
but the deaf person must look out for himself."</p><p><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a></p>

<p>"Either state is to be regretted, if there is no hope of relief,"
remarked Quincy. He thought he would refer to Dr.
Tillotson, but they were approaching the centre of the
town, and he knew he would not have time to explain his
action before he reached the post office, so he determined
to postpone it until they were on the way home.</p>

<p>There were three letters for himself, two for Alice and
a lot of papers and magazines for Uncle Ike. He resumed
his seat in the sleigh and they started on their journey
homeward.</p>

<p>"Would you like to go back the same way that we came?"
asked Quincy, "or shall we go by the upper road and come
by Deacon Mason's?"</p>

<p>"I should like to stop and see Huldy," said Alice, and
Quincy took the upper road.</p>

<p>Conversation lagged on the homeward trip. Alice held
her two letters in her hand and looked at them several
times, apparently trying to recognize the handwriting. As
Quincy glanced at her sidewise, he felt sure that he saw
tears in her eyes, and he decided that it would be an inappropriate
time to announce the subject of the new doctor.
In fact, he was beginning to think, the more his mind dwelt
upon the subject, that he had taken an inexcusable liberty
in arranging for Dr. Tillotson to come down without first
speaking to her, or at least to her brother or uncle. But
the deed was done, and he must find some way to have her
see the doctor, and get his opinion about her eyes.</p>

<p>Quincy spent so much time revolving this matter in his
mind, that he was quite astonished when he looked around
and found himself at the exact place where he spoke those
words to Huldy Mason that had ended in the accident.
This time he gave careful attention to horse and hill and
curve, and a moment later he drew up the sleigh at Deacon
Mason's front gate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason welcomed them at the door and they were
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>shown into the parlor, where Huldy sat at the piano. The
young girls greeted each other warmly, and Mrs. Mason
and Huldy both wished Quincy and Alice to stay to tea.
They declined, saying they had many letters to read before
supper and 'Zekiel would think something had happened
to them if they did not come home.</p>

<p>"I will send Hiram down to let them know," said Mrs.
Mason.</p>

<p>"You must really excuse us this time," protested Quincy.
"Some other time perhaps Miss Pettengill will accept your
hospitality."</p>

<p>"But when?" asked Mrs. Mason. "We might as well
fix a time right now."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Huldy, "and we won't let them go till they
promise."</p>

<p>"Well, my plan," said Mrs. Mason, "is this. Have 'Zekiel
and Alice and Mr. Sawyer come over next Monday afternoon
about five o'clock, and we will have tea at six, and we
will have some music in the evening. I have so missed
your singing, Mr. Sawyer, since you went away."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Huldy, "I think it is real mean of you, Alice,
not to let him come and see us oftener."</p>

<p>Alice flushed and stammered, "I&mdash;I&mdash;I do not keep
him from coming to see you. Why, yes, I have too," said
she, as a thought flashed through her mind. "I will tell you
the truth, Mrs. Mason. Mr. Sawyer offered to do some
writing for me, and I have kept him very busy."</p>

<p>She stopped and Quincy continued:</p>

<p>"I did do a little writing for her, Mrs. Mason, during the
great snowstorm, and it was as great a pleasure to me, as I
hope it was a help to her, for I had nothing else to do."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Mason, "you can settle that matter
between yer. All that Huldy and me wants to know is,
will all three of you come and take tea with us next Monday
night?"</p>

<p><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>"I shall be greatly pleased to do so," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"If 'Zekiel will come, I will," said Alice, and Quincy for
an instant felt a slight touch of wounded feeling because
Alice had ignored him entirely in accepting the invitation.</p>

<p>As they drove home, Alice said: "Mrs. Mason managed
that nicely, didn't she? I didn't wish to appear too eager
to come, for Huldy might have suspected."</p>

<p>"What mystery is this?" asked Quincy. "I really don't
know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"What!" said Alice. "Didn't 'Zekiel tell you about the
surprise party that Mr. Strout was getting up, and that
you, 'Zekiel, and I were not to be invited?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said Quincy. "How stupid I have been!
I knew all about it and that it was to be next Monday, but
Mrs. Mason asked us so honestly to come to tea, and Huldy
joined in so heartily, that for the time being I got things
mixed, and besides, to speak frankly, Miss Pettengill, I
was thinking of something else."</p>

<p>"And what was it?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, determined to break the ice, "I
will tell you. I was wondering why you said you would
come to tea if 'Zekiel would come."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Alice, laughing. "You thought I was very
ungenerous to leave you out of the question entirely."</p>

<p>"Honestly I did think so," remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Alice, "I did it from the most generous
of motives. I thought you knew about the surprise party
as well as I did. I knew 'Zekiel would go with me and I
thought that perhaps you had some other young lady in
view for your companion."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Quincy. "Whom could I have had in
view?"</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you whom I think?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I wish you would," Quincy replied.</p><p><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a></p>

<p>"Well," said Alice, "I thought it might be Lindy Putnam."</p>

<p>Quincy bit his lip and gave the reins a savage jerk, as
he turned up the short road that led to the Pettengill
house. "What could make you think that, Miss Pettengill?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have only one reason to give," Alice replied,
"for that opinion, but the fact is, when we made our call
on Mrs. Putnam she pounded on the floor three times with
her crutch before you came upstairs. Am I justified, Mr.
Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are," said Quincy. "I should have
thought so myself if I had been in your place."</p>

<p>But when he reached his room he threw his letters on
the table, his coat and hat on the bed, and thrusting his
hands into his pockets, he walked rapidly up and down the
room, saying to himself in a savage whisper, "Confound
that Putnam girl; she is a hoodoo."</p>

<p>Quincy was philosophical, and his excited feelings soon
quieted down. It would come out all right in the end.
Alice would find that he had not intended to take Miss
Putnam to the surprise party. He could not betray Lindy's
confidence just at that time, even to justify himself. He
must wait until Mrs. Putnam died. It might be years from
now before the time came to destroy that letter, and he
could not, until then, disclose to Alice the secret that Lindy
had confided to him. Yes, it would come out all right in
the end, for it might be if Alice thought he was in love with
Lindy that she would give more thought to him. He had
read somewhere that oftentimes the best way to awaken a
dormant love was to appear to fall in love with some one
else.</p>

<p>Somewhat reconciled to the situation by his thoughts,
he sat down to read his letters. The first one that he took
up was from the confectioner. It informed him that his
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>order would receive prompt attention, and the writer
thanked him for past favors and solicited a continuance of
the same. The second was from Ernst. It was short and
to the point, and written in his characteristic style. It said:</p>

<p>"Dear Quincy:&mdash;Pseudonym received. Bruce Douglas is
a name to conjure with. It smacks of 'Auld Lang Syne.'
The Scotch are the only people on the face of the earth who
were never conquered. You will remember, if you haven't
forgotten your ancient history, that the Roman general sent
back word to his emperor that the d&mdash;d country wasn't
worth conquering. Enclosures also at hand. The shorter
ones are more songs than poems. I will turn them over to a
music publisher, who is a friend of mine. Will report his
decision later.</p>

<p>"I gave the long poem to Francis Lippitt, the well-known
composer, and he is delighted with it and wishes to set it to
music. He is great on grand choruses, Bach fugues, and
such like. If he sets it to music he will have it sung by the
Handel and Haydn Society, for he is a great gun among
them just now. The eight stories have reached New York
by this time, and Jameson is reading 'Her Native Land.'</p>

<p>"With best regards to Mr. Bruce Douglas and yourself.</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Leopold Ernst</span>.
</p>

<p>The third letter was from the Adjutant-General's office,
and Quincy smiled as he finished the first sheet, folded it
up and replaced it in the envelope. As he read the second
the smile left his face. "Who would have thought it?" he
said to himself. "Well, after all, heroes are made out of
strange material. He is the man for my money and I'll
back him up, and beat that braggart."</p>

<p>On the following Sunday, after dinner, Quincy had a
chat with Uncle Ike. He took the opportunity of asking
the old gentleman if he was fully satisfied with the progress
towards recovery that his niece was making.</p><p><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></p>

<p>"I don't see that she is making any progress," said Uncle
Ike frankly. "I don't think she can see a bit better than
she could when she came home. In fact, I don't think she
can see as well. She had a pair of glasses made of black
rubber, with a pinhole in the centre of them, that she could
read a little with, but I notice now that she never puts them
on."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Quincy, "perhaps I have taken an
unwarrantable liberty, Uncle Ike; but when I was last in
Boston I heard of a new doctor who has made some wonderful
cures, and I have engaged him to come down here
next week and see your niece. Of course, if you object I
will write to him not to come, and no harm will be done."</p>

<p>Quincy did not think it necessary to state that he had
paid the doctor his fee of one hundred dollars in advance.</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Ike, "I certainly sha'n't object, if the
doctor can do her any good. But I should like to know
something about the course of treatment, the nature of it,
I mean, before she gives up her present doctor."</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean," said Quincy. "I want you to
be so kind as to take this whole matter off my hands, just
as though I had made the arrangement at your suggestion.
I am going down for the doctor next Thursday noon.
Won't you ride down with me and meet Dr. Tillotson?
You can talk to him on the way home, and then you can
manage the whole matter yourself, and do as you think
best about changing doctors."</p>

<p>"You have been very kind to my niece, Mr. Sawyer,
since you have been here," said Uncle Ike, "and very helpful
to her. I attribute your interest in her case to your
kindness of heart and a generosity which is seldom found
in the sons of millionaires. But take my advice, Mr. Sawyer,
and let your feelings stop there."</p>

<p>"I do not quite understand you," replied Quincy, though
from a sudden sinking of his heart he felt that he did.</p><p><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a></p>

<p>"Then I will speak plainer," said Uncle Ike. "Don't fall
in love with my niece, Mr. Sawyer. She is a good girl, a
sweet girl, and some might call her a beautiful one, but she
has her limitations. She is not fitted to sit in a Beacon
Street parlor; and your parents and sisters would not be
pleased to have you place her there. Excuse an old man,
Mr. Sawyer, but you know wisdom cometh with age, although
its full value is not usually appreciated by the
young."</p>

<p>Quincy, for the first time in his life, was entirely at a
loss for a reply. He burned to declare his love then and
there; but how could he do so in the face of such a plain
statement of facts? He did the best thing possible under
the circumstances; he quietly ignored Uncle Ike's advice,
and thanking him for his kindness in consenting to meet
the new doctor he bade him good afternoon and went to
his room.</p>

<p>After Quincy had gone Uncle Ike rubbed his hands
together gleefully and shook with laughter.</p>

<p>"The sly rogue!" he said to himself. "Wanted Uncle
Ike to help him out." Then he laughed again. "If he don't
love her he will take my advice, but if he does, what I told
him will drive him on like spurs in the side of a horse. He
is a good fellow, a great deal better than his father and the
rest of his family, for he isn't stuck up. I like him, but my
Alice is good enough for him even if he were a good deal
better than he is. How it would tickle me to hear my niece
calling the Hon. Nathaniel Sawyer papa!" And Uncle Ike
laughed until his sides shook.</p>

<p>Monday promised to be a dull day. 'Zekiel told Quincy
at breakfast, after the others had left the table, that Alice
had spoken to him about Mrs. Mason's invitation to tea,
and, of course, he was going. Quincy said that he had
accepted the invitation and would be pleased to accompany
him and his sister.</p><p><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a></p>

<p>After breakfast he heard Alice singing in the parlor, and
joining her there told her that he had received a letter from
Mr. Ernst, which he would like to read to her. Alice was
delighted with the letter, and they both laughed heartily
over it, Quincy humorously apologizing for the swear word
by saying that being historical it could not be profane.</p>

<p>Alice had in her hand the two letters that she had received
on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Have you answered your letters?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, I have not even heard them read," she replied.
"Uncle Ike has grown tired all at once and won't read to
me nor write for me. I don't understand him at all. I sent
for him yesterday afternoon, after you came down, and told
him what I wanted him to do. He sent back word that he
was too busy and I must get somebody else, but who can I
get? Mandy and 'Zekiel are both too much occupied with
their own duties to help me."</p>

<p>"If I can be of any service to you, Miss Pettengill, you
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think I should dare to let you read these
letters," interrupted Alice, laughing. "No doubt they are
from two of my lady friends, and I have always heard that
men consider letters that women write to each other very
silly and childish."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have not told you," said Quincy, "that I have
two sisters and am used to that sort of thing. When I was
in college hardly a day passed that I did not get a letter
from one or the other of them, and they brightened up my
life immensely."</p>

<p>"What are their names and how old are they?" asked
Alice.</p>

<p>"The elder," replied Quincy, "is nineteen and her name
is Florence Estelle."</p>

<p>"What a sweet name!" said Alice.</p><p><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a></p>

<p>"The younger is between fifteen and sixteen, and is
named Maude Gertrude."</p>

<p>"Is she as dignified as her name?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Far from it," remarked Quincy. "She would be a tomboy
if she had an opportunity. Mother and father call
them Florence and Maude, for they both abhor nicknames,
but among ourselves they are known as Flossie, or Stell,
and Gertie."</p>

<p>"What was your nickname?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "they used to call me Quinn, but
that had a Hibernian sound to it, and Maude nicknamed me
Ad, which she said was short for adder. She told me she
called me that because I was so deaf that I never heard her
when she asked me to take her anywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Sawyer, if you will promise not to laugh out
loud, I will be pleased to have you read these letters to me.
You can smile all you wish to, for of course I can't see
you."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Quincy; and he advanced towards her,
took the two letters and drew a chair up beside her.</p>

<p>"My dear May," read Quincy. He stopped suddenly,
and turning to Alice said, "Is this letter for you?"</p>

<p>"Before we go any further," said Alice, "I must explain
my various names and nicknames. I was named Mary
Alice, the Mary being my mother's name, while the Alice
was a favorite of my father's. Mother always called me
Mary and father always called me Alice! and brother 'Zekiel
and Uncle Ike seem to like the name Alice best. When I
went to Commercial College to study they asked me my
name and I said naturally Mary A. Pettengill. Then the
girls began to call me May, and the boys, or young men
I suppose you call them, nicknamed me Miss Atlas, on
account of my initials. Now that I have given you a chart
of my names to go by, the reading will no doubt be plain
sailing in future."</p><p><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></p>

<p>Quincy laughed and said, "I should call it a M.A.P.
instead of a chart."</p>

<p>"Fie! Mr. Sawyer, to make such a joke upon my poor
name. No doubt you have thought of one that would please
you better than any I have mentioned."</p>

<p>Quincy thought he had, but he wisely refrained from
saying so. He could not help thinking, however, that Miss
Atlas was a very appropriate name for a girl who was all
the world to him. It is evident that Uncle Ike's words of
advice the previous afternoon had not taken very deep
root in Quincy's heart.</p>

<p>He resumed his reading:</p>

<p>"My dear May:&mdash;How are you getting along in that dismal
country town, and how are your poor eyes? I know you
can't write to me, but I want you to know that I have not
forgotten you. Every time I see my sister, Stella, she waves
your photograph before my eyes. You know you promised
me one before you were sick. Just send it to me, and
it will be just as nice as a good, long letter. As somebody
else will probably read this to you, in order to keep them
from committing a robbery I send you only one kiss.</p>

<p class="right3">
From your loving,</p>
<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Emma Farnum</span>."
</p>

<p>"Are you smiling, Mr. Sawyer?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he answered. "I am looking grieved because
Miss Farnum has such a poor opinion of me."</p>

<p>Alice laughed merrily. "Emma is a very bright, pretty
girl," said Alice. "She boarded at the same house that I
did. Her sister Stella is married to a Mr. Dwight. I will
answer her letter as she suggests by sending her the promised
photograph. On the bureau in my room, Mr. Sawyer,
you will find an envelope containing six photographs. I
had them taken about a month before I was sick. Underneath
<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>you will find some heavy envelopes that the photographer
gave me to mail them in."</p>

<p>Quincy went upstairs three steps at a time. He found
the package, and impelled by an inexplicable curiosity he
counted the pictures and found there were seven. "She
said six," he thought to himself. "I am positive she said
there were only six." He took one of the pictures and put
it in one of the mailing envelopes. He took another picture,
and after giving it a long, loving look he placed it in
the inside pocket of his coat, and with a guilty flush upon
his face he fled from the room.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the open parlor door a second thought,
which is said to be the best, came to him, and he was about
turning to go upstairs and replace the picture when Alice's
acute ear heard him and she asked, "Did you find them?"</p>

<p>Quincy, seeing that retreat was now impossible, said,
"Yes," and resumed his seat beside her.</p>

<p>"Did you find six?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"There are five upstairs in the envelope and one here
ready to address," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Her address," continued Alice, "is Miss Emma Farnum,
care Cotton &amp; Co., Real Estate Brokers, Tremont
Row."</p>

<p>Quincy went to the table, wrote the address as directed,
and tied the envelope with the string attached.</p>

<p>"I am afraid the other letter cannot be so easily answered,"
said Alice. "Look at the signature, please, and
see if it is not from Bessie White."</p>

<p>"It is signed Bessie," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I thought so," exclaimed Alice. "She works for the
same firm that I did."</p>

<p>Quincy read the following:</p>

<p>"My Dear May:&mdash;I know that you will be glad to learn
what is going on at the great dry goods house of Borden,<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>
Waitt, &amp; Fisher. Business is good, and we girls are all
tired out when night comes and have to go to a party or
the theatre to get rested. Mr. Ringgold, the head bookkeeper,
is disconsolate over your absence, and asks done
or more of us every morning if we have heard from Miss
Pettengill. Then, every afternoon, he says, 'Did I ask you
this morning how Miss Pettengill was getting along?' Of
course it is this devotion to the interest of the firm that leads
him to ask these questions."</p>

<p>Alice flushed slightly, and turning to Quincy said, "Are
you smiling, Mr. Sawyer? There is nothing in it, I assure
you; Bessie is a great joker and torments the other girls
unmercifully."</p>

<p>"I am glad there is nothing in it," said Quincy. "If I
were a woman I would be afraid to marry a bookkeeper.
My household cash would have to balance to a cent, and
at the end of the year he would insist on housekeeping
showing a profit."</p>

<p>Alice regained her composure and Quincy continued his
reading:</p>

<p>"What do you think! Rita Sanguily has left, and they
say she is going to marry a Dr. Culver, who lives up on
Beacon Hill somewhere."</p>

<p>Quincy started a little as he read this, but made no comment.</p>

<p>"I was out to see Stella Dwight the other day, and she
showed me a picture of you. Can you spare one to your
old friend,</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Bessie White</span>.
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;- I don't expect an answer, but I shall expect the
picture. I shall write you whenever I get any news, and
send you a dozen kisses and two big hugs. B.W."</p><p><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a></p>

<p>"She is more liberal than Miss Farnum," remarked
Quincy. "She is not afraid that I will commit robbery."</p>

<p>"No," rejoined Alice, "but I cannot share with you.
Bessie White is the dearest friend I have in the world."</p>

<p>"Miss White is fortunate," said Quincy, "but who is
Rita Sanguily, if I am not presuming in asking the question?"</p>

<p>"She is a Portuguese girl," answered Alice, "with black
eyes and beautiful black hair. She is very handsome and
can talk Portuguese, French, and Spanish. She held a certain
line of custom on this account. Do you know her?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy, "but I think I know Dr. Culver."</p>

<p>"What kind of a looking man is he?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh! he is tall and heavily built, with large bright blue
eyes and tawny hair," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I like such marked contrasts in husband and wife," remarked
Alice.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Quincy, looking at himself in a looking
glass which hung opposite, and then at Alice; "but how
about Miss White's picture?"</p>

<p>"Can I trouble you to get one?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," replied Quincy; but he went up the
stairs this time one step at a time. He was deliberating
whether he should return that picture that was in his coat
pocket or keep it until the original should be his own. He
entered the room, took another picture and another envelope
and came slowly downstairs. His crime at first had
been unpremeditated, but his persistence was deliberate
felony.</p>

<p>"Now there are four left," said Alice, as Quincy entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Just four," he replied. "I counted them to make sure."
He sat at the table and wrote. "Will this do?" he asked:
"Miss Bessie White, care of Borden, Waitt, &amp; Fisher, Boston,
Mass.?"</p><p><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, thank you so much," said Alice.</p>

<p>At this moment Mandy appeared at the door and announced
dinner, and Quincy had the pleasure of leading
Alice to her accustomed seat at the table.</p>

<p>"I took the liberty while upstairs," said Quincy, "to
glance at a book that was on your bureau entitled, 'The
Love of a Lifetime,' Have you read it?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Alice. "I commenced it the night before
I was taken sick."</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased to read it aloud to you," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I should enjoy listening to it very much," she replied.</p>

<p>So after dinner they returned to the parlor and Quincy
read aloud until the descending sun again sent its rays
through the parlor windows to fall upon Alice's face and
hair, and Quincy thought to himself how happy he should
be if the fair girl who sat beside him ever became the love
of his lifetime.</p>

<p>Alice finally said she was tired and must have a rest.
Quincy called Mandy and she went to her room. A few
moments later Quincy was in his own room and after locking
his door sat down to inspect his plunder.</p>

<p>Alice did not rest, however; something was on her mind.
She found her way to the bureau and took up the pictures.</p>

<p>"Only four," she said to herself, after counting them.
"Let me see," she continued, "the photographer gave me
thirteen,&mdash;a baker's dozen he called it. Now to whom
have I given them? 'Zekiel, one; Uncle Ike, two; Mrs.
Putnam, three; Stella Dwight, four; Bessie White, five;
Emma Farnum, six; Mr. Ringgold, seven; Mr. Fisher,
eight. That would leave five and I have only four. Now
to whom did I give that other picture?"</p>

<p>And the guilty thief sat on the other side of the partition
and exulted in his crime. There came a loud rap at
his door, and Quincy started up so suddenly that he dropped
the picture and it fell to the floor. He caught it up quickly
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>and placed it in his pocket. As he unlocked the door and
opened it he heard loud rapping on the door of Miss Pettengill's
room.</p>

<p>Looking into the entry he saw 'Zekiel, who cried out,
"Say, you folks, have you forgotten that you have been
invited out to tea this evening, and that we are going to give
a surprise party to Mr. Strout and his friends? I am all
dressed and the sleigh is ready."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he dashed downstairs.</p>

<p>While Quincy was donning his sober suit of black, with
a Prince Albert coat and white tie, Alice had put on an
equally sober costume of fawn colored silk, with collar and
cuffs of dainty lace, with little dashes of pink ribbon, by
way of contrast in color.</p><p><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>THE SURPRISE PARTY.<br /></h3>

<p>After Alice had taken her place on the back seat in
the double sleigh, Quincy started to take his place on
the front seat, beside 'Zekiel, but the latter motioned him
to sit beside Alice, and Quincy did so without needing any
urging.</p>

<p>As 'Zekiel took up the reins, Quincy leaned forward and
touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I've just thought," said he, "that I've made a big blunder
and I can't see how I can repair it."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked 'Zekiel; and Alice turned an
inquiring face towards Quincy.</p>

<p>"The fact is," Quincy continued, "I ordered some ice
cream and cake sent down from the city for the show to-night,
but I forgot, I am ashamed to say, to make arrangements
to have it sent up to Deacon Mason's. It will be
directed to him, but the station agent won't be likely to
send it up before to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What time is it?" asked 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>Quincy looked at his watch and replied, "It is just half-past
four."</p>

<p>"Why do we go so early?" inquired Alice, "they will not
have tea till six."</p>

<p>"Oh," said 'Zekiel, "I intended to give you a sleigh ride
first anyway. Now with this pair of trotters I am going to
take you over to Eastborough Centre and have you back at
Deacon Mason's barn door in just one hour and with appetites
that it will take two suppers to satisfy."</p>

<p>With this 'Zekiel whipped up his horses and they dashed
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>off towards the town. A short distance beyond Uncle Ike's
chicken coop they met Abner Stiles driving home from the
Centre. He nodded to 'Zekiel, but Quincy did not notice
him, being engaged in conversation with Alice at the time.
They reached the station, and Quincy gave orders to have
the material sent up, so that it would arrive at about half-past
nine. 'Zekiel more than kept his promise, for they
reached Deacon Mason's barn at exactly twenty-nine minutes
past five. Hiram was on hand to put up the horses,
and told Quincy in a whisper that some of the boys thought
it was mighty mean not to invite the Pettengill folks and
their boarder.</p>

<p>The sharp air had whetted the appetites of the travellers
during their six-mile ride, and they did full justice to the
nicely-cooked food that the Deacon's wife placed before
them. Supper was over at quarter before seven, and in
half an hour the dishes were washed and put away and the
quartette of young folks adjourned to the parlor.</p>

<p>Quincy took his seat at the piano and began playing a
popular air.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us sing something," cried Huldy. "You know
I have been taking lessons from Professor Strout, and he
says I have improved greatly. If he says it you know it
must be so; and, did you know Alice, that 'Zekiel has a
fine baritone voice?"</p>

<p>"We used to sing a good deal together," said Alice, "but
I was no judge of voices then."</p>

<p>"Well, 'Zeke don't know a note of music," continued
Huldy, "but he has a quick ear and he seems to know naturally
just how to use his voice."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense," said 'Zekiel, "I don't know how to sing, I
only hum a little. Sing us something, Mr. Sawyer," said
he.</p>

<p>Quincy sang a song very popular at the time, entitled
"The Jockey Hat and Feather." All four joined in the
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>chorus, and at the close the room rang with laughter.
Quincy then struck up another popular air, "Pop Goes the
Weasel," and this was sung by the four with great gusto.
Then he looked over the music on the top of the piano,
which was a Bourne &amp; Leavitt square, and found a copy
of the cantata entitled, "The Haymakers," and for half an
hour the solos and choruses rang through the house and
out upon the evening air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason looked in the door and said, "I wouldn't
sing any more now, it is nearly eight o'clock."</p>

<p>And thus admonished they began talking of Tilly James's
engagement to Sam Hill and the sale of the grocery store,
which was to come off the next day.</p>

<p>"I wonder who will buy it?" asked Huldy.</p>

<p>"Well, I hear Strout has got some backers," said 'Zekiel,
"but I don't see what good it will be to him unless he is
appointed postmaster. They say he has written to Washington
and applied for the position."</p>

<p>Quincy pricked up his ears at this. He had almost forgotten
this chance to put another spoke in Mr. Strout's
wheel. He made a mental memorandum to send telegrams
to two Massachusetts congressmen with whom he was well
acquainted to hold up Strout's appointment at all hazards
until they heard from him again.</p>

<p>A little after seven o'clock the advance guard of the surprise
party arrived at Hill's grocery, which was the appointed
rendezvous. Abner Stiles drew Strout to one side
and said, "I saw the Pettengill folks and that city feller in
'Zeke's double sleigh going over to the Centre at about five
o'clock."</p>

<p>"So much the better," said Strout.</p>

<p>"Do you know where they've gone?" inquired Stiles.</p>

<p>"No, but I guess I can find out," Strout replied.</p>

<p>He had spied Mandy Skinner among a crowd of girls on
the platform. He called her and she came to him.</p><p><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a></p>

<p>"Did Mr. Pettengill and his sister take tea at home to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mandy. "I told them I was going away to-night,
and Mr. Pettengill said they were going away too.
And Cobb's twins told me at dinner time that they wouldn't
be home to supper; and as I didn't wish to eat too much,
considering what was coming later, I didn't get no supper
at all. I left Crowley to look out for Uncle Ike, who
is always satisfied if he gets toast and tea."</p>

<p>"Don't you know where they've gone?" inquired Strout.</p>

<p>"Over to the hotel, I guess," said Mandy. "I heard Mr.
Sawyer tell Miss Alice that they had good oysters over
there, and she said as how she was dying to get some raw
oysters."</p>

<p>"Things couldn't have worked better," remarked Strout,
as he rejoined Abner, who was smoking a cheap cigar.
"The Pettengill crowd has gone over to the hotel to supper.
You ought not to smoke, Abner, if you are going to
kiss the girls to-night," said Strout.</p>

<p>"I guess I sha'n't do much kissin'," replied Abner, "except
what I give my fiddle with the bow, and that fiddle of
mine is used to smoke."</p>

<p>Strout looked around and saw that the whole party had
assembled. There were about fifty in all, very nearly
equally divided as regarded numbers into fellows and girls.</p>

<p>"Now I am going ahead," said Strout, "to interview the
old lady, before we jump in on them. The rest of you just
follow Abner and wait at the top of the hill, just round the
corner, so that they can't see you from the house. I have
arranged with Hiram to blow his bugle when everything is
ready, and when you hear it you just rush down hill laughing
and screaming and yelling like wild Injuns. Come in
the back door, right into the big kitchen, and when Miss
Huldy comes into the room you just wait till I deliver my
speech."</p><p><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a></p>

  <p class="caption">"Samanthy Green," As She Appears In The Play.</p>
</div>

<p>Strout started off, and the party followed Abner to the
appointed waiting place.</p>

<p>Strout knocked lightly at the kitchen door, and it was
opened by Mrs. Mason.</p>

<p>"Is the Deacon at home?" inquired he, endeavoring to
disguise his voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Mason, "he has gone to Eastborough
Centre on some business, but told me he would be back
about half past nine."</p>

<p>"Is Hiram here?" asked Strout.</p>

<p>"He's out in the kitchen polishing up his bugle," said
Mrs. Mason. "But come in a minute, Mr. Strout, I have
got something to fell you."</p>

<p>Strout stepped in and quietly closed the door.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mrs. Mason? I hope Huldy isn't
sick."</p>

<p>"No," said she, "it's unfortunate it has happened as it
has, but it couldn't be avoided. You see she invited some
company to tea, and I supposed that they would have gone
home long 'fore this. You see, Huldy don't suspect nothing,
and she has asked them to spend the evening, and I
don't see how in the world I am going to get rid of them."</p>

<p>"Don't do it," said Strout. "Extend to them an invitation
in my name to remain and enjoy the evening's festivities
with us. No doubt Miss Huldy will be pleased to have
them stay."</p>

<p>"I know she will," said Mrs. Mason, "and I'll give them
your invite as soon as you're ready."</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Mason," said Strout, "just tell Hiram I am
ready to have him blow that bugle, and when you hear it
you can just tell your daughter and her friends what's up."</p>

<p>Hiram soon joined Strout outside the kitchen door. The
latter went out in the road and looked up the hill to see
if his party was all ready. Abner waved his hand, and<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>
Strout rushed back to Hiram and cried, "Give it to 'em
now, Hiram, and do your darnedest!"</p>

<p>Huldy and her friends were engaged in earnest conversation,
when a loud blast burst upon the air, followed by a
succession of piercing notes from Hiram's old cracked
bugle.</p>

<p>Huldy jumped to her feet and exclaimed, "What does
Hiram want to blow that horrid old bugle at this time of
night for? I will tell ma to stop him."</p>

<p>She started towards the parlor door, when the whole
party heard shouts of laughter, screams from female voices,
and yells from male ones that would have done credit to a
band of wild Comanches.</p>

<p>All stood still and listened. Again the laughter, screams,
and yells were heard. This time they seemed right under
the parlor window.</p>

<p>A look of surprise and almost terror passed over Alice's
face, and turning to Quincy unthinkingly she said in a low
whisper, "What was that, Quincy? What does it mean?"</p>

<p>Quincy's heart jumped as his Christian name fell from
the girl's lips. He put his left hand over his heart (her
picture was in the pocket just beneath it) and said as naturally
as he could, although with a little tremor in his voice,
"It's all right, Alice, that's Mr. Strout's idea of a surprise
party."</p>

<p>"A surprise party!" cried Huldy, "who for? Me?"</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Mason opened the door and entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Huldy," said she, "Professor Strout wishes me to tell
you that he and his friends have come to give you a surprise
party, and he wished me to invite you," turning to
the others, "as Huldy's friends to remain and enjoy the festivities
of the evening."</p>

<p>Then the poor old lady, who had been under a nervous
strain for the past ten days, and who had come nearer telling<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>untruths than she ever had before in her life, began to
laugh, and then to cry, and finally sank into a chair, overcome
for the moment.</p>

<p>"I wish Abraham was here," said she, "I guess I'm getting
a little bit nervous."</p>

<p>Let us return to the great kitchen, which the members
of the surprise party now had in their possession. A dozen
of the men produced lanterns, which they lighted, and
which were soon hung upon the walls of the kitchen, one
of the number having brought a hammer and some nails.</p>

<p>It was a pound party, and two young men fetched in a
basket containing the goodies which had been brought for
the supper. Strout had made arrangements to have the
hot coffee made at the grocery store, and it was to be
brought down at half-past nine.</p>

<p>He arranged his party so that all could get a good view
of the door through which Huldy must come. He stepped
forward within ten feet of the door and stood expectantly.
Why this delay? Strout looked around at the party. There
were Tilly James and Sam Hill; Cobb's twins, and each
brought a pretty girl; Robert Wood, Benjamin Bates, and
Arthur Scates were equally well supplied; Lindy Putnam,
after much solicitation, had consented to come with Emmanuel
Howe, the clergyman's son, and he was in the
seventh heaven of delight; Mandy stood beside Hiram
and his bugle, and Samantha Green had Farmer Tompkins's
son George for escort. It was a real old-fashioned,
democratic party. Clergymen's sons, farmers' sons, girls
that worked out, chore boys, farm hands, and an heiress to
a hundred thousand dollars, met on a plane of perfect
equality without a thought of caste, and to these were soon
to be added more farmers' sons and daughters and the only
son of a millionaire.</p>

<p>"Just give them a call," said Strout, turning to Hiram,
and the latter gave a blast on his bugle, which sent fingers
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>to the ears of his listeners. The handle of the door turned
and opened and Huldy entered, her mother leaning upon
her arm.</p>

<p>They were greeted by hand clapping and cries of "Good
evening" from the party, and all eyes were fixed upon
Strout, who stood as if petrified and gazed at the three figures
that came through the open door and stood behind
Huldy and her mother. Hamlet following the fleeting
apparition on the battlements of the castle at Elsinore,
Macbeth viewing Banquo at his feast, or Richard the Third
gazing on the ghostly panorama of the murdered kings and
princes, could not have felt weaker at heart than did Professor
Strout when he saw the new-comers and realized
that they were there by his express invitation.</p>

<p>The members of the surprise party thought Strout had
forgotten his speech, and cries of "Speech!" "Speech!"
"Give us the speech!" fell upon his ear, but no words fell
from his lips. It was a cruel blow, but no crueler than the
unfounded stories that he had started and circulated about
the town for the past three months. Those who had
thought it was mean not to invite the Pettengills and Mr.
Sawyer enjoyed his discomfiture and were the loudest in
calling for a speech.</p>

<p>The situation became somewhat strained, and Huldy
looked up to Quincy with an expression that seemed to say,
How are we going to get out of this?</p>

<p>Quite a number of the party saw this look and immediately
began calling out, "Mr. Sawyer, give us a speech!"
"A speech from Mr. Sawyer!"</p>

<p>Huldy smiled and nodded to Quincy, and then there
were loud cries of "Speech! Speech!" and clapping of
hands.</p>

<p>Abner Stiles got up and gave his chair to Professor
Strout, who sank into it, saying as he did so, "I guess it was
the heat."</p><p><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></p>

<p>Quincy stepped forward and bowing to Huldy and then
to Mrs. Mason, addressed the party in a low but clearly distinct
voice.</p>

<p>"Authorized by these ladies to speak for them, I desire
to return sincere thanks for this manifestation of your regard
for them. Your visit was entirely unexpected by Miss
Mason and a great surprise to her. But it is a most pleasant
surprise, and she desires me to thank you again and
again for your kind thoughts and your good company this
evening. She and her mother join in giving you a most
hearty welcome. They wish you to make yourselves at
home and will do all in their power to make the evening a
happy one and one long to be remembered by the inhabitants
of Mason's Corner. The inception of this happy
event, I learn, is due to Professor Strout, who for some
time, I understand, has been Miss Mason's music teacher,
and the ladies, whose ideas I am expressing, desire me to
call upon him to take charge of the festivities and bring
them to a successful close, as he is no doubt competent and
willing to do."</p>

<p>Quincy bowed low and retired behind the other members
of the party.</p>

<p>Quincy's speech was greeted with cheers and more clapping
of hands. Even Strout's friends were pleased by the
graceful compliment paid to the Professor, and joined in
the applause.</p>

<p>Strout had by this time fully recovered his equanimity.
A chair was placed upon the kitchen table and Abner Stiles
was boosted up and took his seat thereon. While he was
tuning up his fiddle the Professor opened a package that
one of the girls handed to him and passed a pair of knitted
woollen wristers to each lady in the company. He gave
three pairs to Huldy, who in turn gave one pair to her
mother and one to Alice. There were several pairs over,
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>as several girls who had been expected to join the party had
not come.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Mason," said the Professor, "could you
kindly supply me with a couple of small baskets, or if not,
with a couple of milk pans?"</p>

<p>The Professor took one of the pans and Robert Wood
the other.</p>

<p>"The ladies wall please form in line," cried the Professor;
which was done. "Now will each lady," said the Professor,
"as she marches between us, throw one wrister in one pan
and t'other wrister in the other pan? Give us a good, lively
march, Abner," he added, and the music began.</p>

<p>The procession passed between the upheld pans, one
wrister of each pair thrown right and the other left, as it
moved on.</p>

<p>The music stopped. "Now, will the ladies please form
in line again," said the Professor, "and as they pass through
each one take a wrister from the pan held by Mr. Wood."</p>

<p>The music started up again and the procession moved
forward and the work of selection was completed.</p>

<p>Again the music stopped. "Now will the gentlemen
form in line, and as they march forward each one take a
wrister from the pan that I hold," said the Professor.</p>

<p>Once more the music started up. The line was formed,
the procession advanced, 'Zekiel and Quincy bringing up
the rear. As Quincy took the last wrister from the pan
that the Professor held, the latter turned quickly away and
beat a tattoo on the bottom of the pan with his knuckles
and cried out, "Gentlemen will please find their partners.
The wristers become the property of the gentlemen."</p>

<p>Then a wild rush took place. Screams of laughter were
heard on every side, and it was fully five minutes before
the excitement subsided, and in response to another tattoo
upon the milk pan by the Professor, the couples, as arranged
by the hand of Fate, formed in line and marched
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>around the great kitchen to the music of a sprightly march
written by the Professor and called "The Wrister March,"
and respectfully dedicated to Miss Hulda Mason. This announcement
was made by Mr. Stiles from his elevated position
upon the kitchen table.</p>

<p>The hand of Fate had acted somewhat strangely. The
Professor and Mandy Skinner stood side by side, as did
'Zekiel Pettengill and Mrs. Mason. Lindy Putnam and
Huldy by a queer twist of fortune were mated with Cobb's
twins.</p>

<p>But Fate did one good act. By chance Quincy and
Alice stood side by side. She looked up at him and said to
her partner, "What is your name, I cannot see your face?"</p>

<p>"My name is Quincy," said Sawyer in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" said Alice, leaning a little more heavily
on his arm.</p>

<p>"So am I," responded Quincy ardently.</p>

<p>After the procession had made several circuits of the
great kitchen, Professor Strout gave a signal, and it broke
up, each gentleman being then at liberty to seek the lady
of his own choice.</p>

<p>"What games shall we play fust?" asked Strout, taking
the centre of the room, and looking round upon the company
with a countenance full of smiles and good nature.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" "Who is it?" came from a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"All right," cried Strout; "that's a very easy game to
play. Now all you ladies git in a line and I'll put this
one chair right front of yer. Now all the gentlemen must
leave the room except one. I suppose we can use the parlor,
Mrs. Mason?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason nodded her head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"I'll 'tend door," said Hiram; and he took his position
accordingly. After the rest of the gentlemen had left the
room, Hiram closed the door, and turning to Huldy said,
"Shall I call them, or will you?"</p>

<p>"You call them," said Huldy.</p><p><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a></p>

<p>"Got the handkerchief ready?" asked Hiram.</p>

<p>Huldy swung a big red bandanna in the air. Opening
a door, Hiram called out in a loud voice, "Obadiah Strout."</p>

<p>As Strout walked towards the line of young girls they
called out together, "Mister, please take a chair."</p>

<p>Strout sat down in a chair. One of the girls who had
the bandanna handkerchief in her hand passed it quickly
over his eyes and tied it firmly behind his head. Two of
the girls then stepped forward and each one taking one
of his hands and extending it at right angles with his body
held it firmly in their grasps. At the same instant his head
was pulled back by one of the girls and a kiss was imprinted
on his upturned mouth.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" screamed the girls in unison. The holds on
the Professor's head and hands were released and he sat upright
in the chair.</p>

<p>"I kinder guess it was Miss Huldy Mason," said he.</p>

<p>A loud laugh burst from the girls, mixed with cries of
"You're wrong!" "You ain't right!" "You didn't get
it!" "You're out!" and similar ejaculations.</p>

<p>The handkerchief was taken from his eyes and he was
marched to the left of the line of girls, which ran length-wise
of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Abner Stiles was the next one called in, and he was subjected
to the same treatment as had befallen his predecessor,
but to the intense disgust of Professor Strout he saw
Hiram Maxwell come on tiptoe from the parlor door, lean
over and kiss Abner Stiles. The thought of course ran
through his mind that he had been subjected to the same
treatment. He was on the point of protesting at this way
of conducting the game when the idea occurred to him
that it would be a huge satisfaction to have that city chap
subjected to the same treatment, and he decided to hold his
peace.</p>

<p>The next one called was 'Zekiel Pettengill, and he was
treated in the same manner as the Professor and Abner had
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>been; but as Hiram leaned over to kiss him, 'Zekiel's foot
slipped upon the floor and struck against Hiram's, Hiram
being in front of him. 'Zekiel then put up both of his feet
and kicked with them in such a way that Hiram was unable
to approach him.</p>

<p>'Zekiel called out, "It's Hiram Maxwell," and the room
rang with the laughs and cries of the girls.</p>

<p>'Zekiel, having guessed who it was, was marched off to
the right of the line of girls.</p>

<p>Strout called out, "Let's play something else," but the
sentiment of the company seemed to be that it wasn't fair
to the others not to give them a chance, so the game continued.
Quincy was the next one called, and to still further
increase the disgust of Strout and Abner, instead of
Hiram leaving the door, as before, one of the girls stepped
out from the line, at a signal from Huldy, and kissed
Quincy. He guessed that it was Miss Huldy Mason, and
was greeted with the same cries that Strout had heard. He
took his place at the left with the latter.</p>

<p>Strout leaned over and whispered in Abner's ear, "That
was a put-up job. I'll get even with Hiram Maxwell before
I get through."</p>

<p>The game continued until all the men had been called in.
With the exception of Emmanuel Howe, none of them
were able to guess who it was. When Emmanuel took
his place by the side of 'Zekiel he confided the fact to him
that he guessed it was Miss Putnam on account of the perfumery
which he had noticed before he left the house with
her.</p>

<p>After this game others followed in quick succession.
There were "Pillow," "Roll the Cover," "Button, Button,
Who's Got the Button?" "Copenhagen," and finally "Post
Office." From all of these games Alice begged to be excused.
She told the Professor that she was not bashful nor
diffident, but that her eyesight was so poor that she knew
she would detract from the pleasure of the others if she
<a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>engaged in the games. The Professor demurred at first,
but said finally that her excuse was a good one. Then he
turned to Abner and remarked that he supposed Mr. Sawyer
would ask to be excused next 'cause his girl wasn't
going to play.</p>

<p>But Quincy had no such intention. After leading Alice
to a seat beside Mrs. Mason, he returned to the company
and took part in every game, entering with spirit and vivacity
into each of them. He invented some forfeits that
one girl objected to the forfeit exacted of her as being all
out of proportion to her offence, the matter was referred
to Quincy. He said that he would remit the original forfeit
and she could kiss him instead. But she objected, saying
that forfeit was worse than the other one. This pleased
Strout greatly, and he remarked to Abner, who kept as
close to him as the tail to a kite, that there was one girl
in town who wasn't afraid to speak her mind.</p>

<p>The game of Post Office was the most trying one to
Quincy. Of his own free will he would not have called
either Huldy or Lindy, but Strout and Abner and all the
rest of them had letters for both of these young ladies.
He was afraid that his failure to call them out might lead
to remark, as he knew that Strout and Abner and Robert
Wood were watching his actions closely. So, near the
middle of the game, when he had been called out, he had a
letter from England for Miss Lindy Putnam.</p>

<p>As she raised her face to his for the kiss on the cheek
that he gave her, she said, "I was afraid you had not forgiven
me, after all."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," said Quincy, and carried away by the
excitement of the occasion, he caught her again in his arms
and gave her another kiss, this time upon the lips.</p>

<p>At this instant Abner Stiles, who was tending door,
opened it and called out, "Takes a long time to pay the
postage on one letter!"</p>

<p>A little later Quincy was again called out, and this time
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>he had a letter from Boston for Miss Mason. He kissed
her on the cheek, as he had done with Lindy. Huldy looked
up with a laugh and said, "Were you as bashful as that
with Miss Putnam?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "at first, but there was double postage
on her letter, the same as on yours." And though
Huldy tried to break away from him he caught her and
kissed her upon the lips, as he had done to Lindy.</p>

<p>Again Abner opened the door and cried out that the
mails would close in one minute, and he'd better get the
stamps on that letter quick.</p>

<p>All such good times come to an end, and the signal for
the close was the return of Deacon Mason from his visit to
town. He was popular with all parties, and Stroutites,
Anti-Stroutites, and neutrals all gathered 'round him and
said they were having a beautiful time, and could they have
a little dance after supper?</p>

<p>The Deacon said he didn't know that dancing in itself
was so bad, for the Bible referred to a great many dances.
"But," said he, "I have always been agin permiscuous dancing."</p>

<p>"But we ain't permiscuous," said Tilly James. "We are
all friends and neighbors."</p>

<p>"Most all," said Strout; but his remark was unnoticed
by all excepting Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well, under the circumstances," concluded the Deacon,
"I don't object to your finishing up with an old-fashioned
reel, and mother and me will jine in with you, so as to countenance
the perceedings."</p>

<p>The call was now made for supper. A procession was
again formed, each gentleman taking the lady who had
accompanied him to the party. They all filed into the
dining-room and took their places around the long table.
The most of them looked at its contents with surprise and
delight. Instead of seeing only home-made cakes, and pies,
and dishes of nuts, and raisins, and apples, that they had
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>expected, occupying the centre of the table, they gazed
upon a large frosted cake, in the centre of which arose what
resembled the spire of a church, made of sugar and adorned
with small American flags and streamers made of various
colored silk ribbons. Flanking the centrepiece at each corner
were large dishes containing mounds of jelly cake,
pound cake, sponge cake, and angel cake. On either side of
the centrepiece, shaped in fancy moulds, were two large
dishes of ice cream, a third full of sherbet, and the
fourth one filled with frozen pudding. In the vacant spaces
about the larger dishes were smaller plates containing the
home-made pies and cake, and the apples, oranges, dates,
figs, raisins, nuts, and candy taken from the pound packages
brought by the members of the surprise party. Piled upon
the table in heaps were the fifty boxes containing the souvenir
gifts that Quincy had ordered.</p>

<p>As they took their places about the table, Quincy felt it
incumbent upon him to say something. Turning to the
Professor he addressed him:</p>

<p>"Professor Strout, I think it is my duty to inform you
that I have made this little addition to the bountiful supper
supplied by you and the members of this party, on behalf
of my friends, Mr. and Miss Pettengill, and myself. I
trust that you will take as much pleasure in disposing of it
as I have in sending it. In the language of the poet I
would now say, 'Fall to and may good digestion wait on
appetite!'"</p>

<p>Quincy's speech was received with applause. The hot
coffee had arrived and was soon circulating in cups, mugs,
and tumblers. Everybody was talking to everybody else at
the same time, and all petty fueds, prejudices, and animosities
were, apparently, forgotten.</p>

<p>The young fellows took the cue from Quincy, who, as
soon as he had finished his little speech, began filling the
plates with the good things provided, and passing them to
the ladies, and in a short time all had been waited upon.<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>
When both hunger and appetite had been satisfied, Quincy
again addressed the company.</p>

<p>"In those small paper boxes," said he, "you will find some
little souvenirs, which you can keep to remind you of this
very pleasant evening, or you can eat them and remember
how sweet they were." A general laugh followed this remark.
"In making your selection," continued Quincy,
"bear in mind that the boxes tied up with red ribbon are
for the ladies, while those having blue ribbons are for the
gentlemen."</p>

<p>A rush was made for the table, and almost instantly each
member of the company became possessed of a souvenir
and was busily engaged in untying the ribbons.</p>

<p>Again Quincy's voice was heard above the tumult.</p>

<p>"In each package," cried he, "will be found printed on a
slip of paper a poetical selection. The poetry, like that
found on valentines, is often very poor, but the sentiment
is there just the same. In the city the plan that we follow
is to pass our own slip to our left-hand neighbor and he or
she reads it."</p>

<p>This was too much for the Professor.</p>

<p>"I don't think," said he, "that we ought to foller that
style of doin' things jest because they do it that way in the
city. We are pretty independent in the country, like to do
thing's our own way."</p>

<p>"Oh! it don't make any difference to me," said Quincy;
"in the city when we get a good thing we are willing to
share it with our partners or friends; you know I said if
you didn't wish to keep your souvenir, you could eat it, and
of course the poetical selection is part of the souvenir."</p>

<p>A peal of laughter greeted this sally, which rose to a
shout when Strout took his souvenir out of the box. It
proved to be a large sugar bee, very lifelike in appearance
and having a little wad of paper rolled up and tucked under
one of the wings.</p><p><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a></p>

<p>As Strout spread out the slip of paper with his fingers,
loud cries of "Eat it!" "Read it!" and "Pass it along!"
came from the company. The Professor stood apparently
undecided what course to pursue, when Tilly James, who
was standing at his left, grabbed it from his fingers, and
running to the end of the table, stood beside young Hill
with an expression that seemed to say, "This is my young
man, and I know he will protect me."</p>

<p>Loud cries of "Read it, Tilly!" came from all parts of
the table.</p>

<p>"Not unless Professor Strout is willing," said Tilly with
mock humility.</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Strout, who, seeing that he
had nothing to gain by objecting, cried out, "Oh, go ahead;
what do I care about such nonsense!"</p>

<p>Tilly then read with much dramatic expression the following
poetical effusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How does the wicked bumblebee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Employ the shining hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stinging folks that he dislikes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Instead of sipping flowers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another loud laugh greeted this; largely due to the
comical expression on Tilly James's face, which so far upset
Quincy's habitual gravity that he was obliged to smile in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>If Strout felt the shot he did not betray it, but turned to
Huldy, who stood at his right, and said, "Now, Miss Mason,
let me read your poetry for you, as they do it in the city."</p>

<p>Huldy hesitated, holding the slip of paper between her
fingers, "Oh! that ain't fair," said Strout. "I've set you a
good example, now you mustn't squeal. Come, walk right
up to the trough."</p>

<p>"I'm no pig," protested Huldy.</p>

<p>As Strout leaned over to take the paper he said in an
<a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>undertone, "No, you are a little dear;" whereat Huldy's
face flushed a bright crimson.</p>

<p>Strout cleared his voice and then read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come wreathe your face with smiles, my dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;A husband you'll find within the year."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was greeted with laughter, clapping of hands, and
cries of "Who is it, Huldy?"</p>

<p>The Professor looked at Huldy inquiringly, but she
averted her eyes. He leaned over and said in an undertone,
"May I keep this?"</p>

<p>Huldy looked up and said in a tone that was heard by
every one at the table, "I don't care; if you like it better than
that one about the bumblebee you can have it."</p>

<p>The Professor then turned to Quincy and said, "Perhaps
Mr. Sawyer will oblige the company by passing his poetry
along, as they do it in the city."</p>

<p>Quincy answered quickly, "Why, certainly," and handed
the slip to his left-hand neighbor, who chanced to be Miss
Seraphina Cotton, who was the teacher in the public school
located at Mason's Corner.</p>

<p>She prided herself on her elocutionary ability, and read
the following with great expression:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though wealth and fame fall to my lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I'd much prefer a little cot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;In which, apart from care and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I'd love my children and my wife."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Strout laughed outright.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Sawyer," said he, "have you seen any
little cot round here that you'd swap your Beacon Street
house for?"</p>

<p>"I've got my eye on some real estate in this town," said
Quincy, "and if you own it perhaps we can make a trade."</p><p><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a></p>

<p>'Zekiel Pettengill passed his slip to Lindy Putnam; it ran
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'An honest man's the noblest work of God,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;No nobler lives than he who tills the sod."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was greeted with shouts and cries of "Good for
'Zeke!" while one of Cobb's twins, who possessed a thin,
high voice, cried out, "He's all wool and a yard wide."</p>

<p>This provoked more shouts and hand-clapping, and
'Zekiel blushed like a peony.</p>

<p>Lindy Putnam handed her slip to Quincy; he took in its
meaning at a glance and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>Strout saw the glance and cried out, "Oh, come, now;
don't leave out nothin'; read it jist as it's writ."</p>

<p>Lindy nodded to Quincy and he read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no heart but hath some wish unfilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;There is no soul without some longing killed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;With heart and soul work for thy heart's desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And turn not back for storm, nor flood, nor fire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This is gittin' quite tragic," said Strout. "I guess we've
had all we want to eat and drink, and have listened to all the
bad poetry we want ter, and I move&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Second the motion," cried Abner Stiles.</p>

<p>"And I move," continued Strout, "that we git back inter
the kitchen, and have a little dance jist to shake our suppers
down."</p>

<p>After the company returned to the kitchen, Abner was
again lifted to his elevated position on the kitchen table,
and the fun began again. There was no doubt that in telling
stories Abner Stiles often drew the long bow, but it was
equally true that he had no superior in Eastborough and
vicinity on the violin, or the fiddle, as he preferred to call it.
He was now in his glory. His fiddle was tucked under his
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>chin, a red silk handkerchief with large yellow polka dots
protecting the violin from injury from his stubbly beard
rather than his chin from being injured by the instrument.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="image8" id="image8" href="images/image8.png">
    <img src="images/image8-tn.png" alt='"The Deacon And His Wife Led Off."'
           title='"The Deacon And His Wife Led Off."' />
  </a>
  <p class="caption">"The Deacon And His Wife Led Off."</p>
</div>

<p>After a few preliminary chords, Abner struck up the
peculiar dance movement very popular in those days, called
"The Cure." As if prearranged, Hiram Maxwell and Mandy
Skinner ran to the centre of the room and began singing
the words belonging to the dance. Abner gradually increased
the speed of the melody, and the singers conformed,
thereto. Faster and faster the music went, and higher and
higher the dancers jumped until the ceiling prevented any
further progress upward. They leaned forward and backward,
they leaned from side to side, but still kept up their
monotonous leaps into the air. Finally, when almost exhausted,
they sank into chairs hastily brought for them,
amid the applause of the party.</p>

<p>Quincy had seen the dance at the city theatres, but acknowledged
to himself that the country version was far
ahead of the city one. At the same time it seemed to him
that the dance savored of barbarism, and he recalled pictures
and stories of Indian dances where the participants
fell to the ground too weak to rise.</p>

<p>"I put my right hand in," called out one of the fellows.
Cries of "Oh, yes, that's it!" came from the company, and
they arranged themselves in two rows, facing each other
and running the length of the long room. They were in
couples, as they came to the party. Abner played the
melody on his violin, and the fellows and girls sang these
words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I put my right hand in,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I put my right hand out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;I give my right hand a shake, shake, shake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And I turn myself about."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As they sang the last line they did turn themselves about
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>so many times that it seemed a wonder to Quincy, who was
an amused spectator, how they kept upon their feet.</p>

<p>Seeing that one of the young ladies in the line was without
a partner, Quincy took his place beside her and joined
in the merriment as heartily as the rest. Then followed all
the changes of "I put my left hand in," "I put my right
foot in," "I put my left foot in," and so on until the whole
party was nearly as much exhausted as Hiram and Mandy
had been.</p>

<p>At this moment the door leading to the parlor opened
and Deacon Mason entered, accompanied by his wife.
They were greeted with shouts of laughter. Quincy looked
at them with astonishment, and had it not been for their
familiar faces, which they had not tried to disguise, he
would not have recognized them.</p>

<p>Out of compliment to their guests, the Deacon and his
wife had gone back to the days of their youth. Probably
from some old chest in the garret each had resurrected a
costume of fifty years before. They advanced into the
room, smiling and bowing to the delighted spectators on
either side. They went directly to Abner, and the latter
bent over to hear what the Deacon whispered in his ear.
The Deacon then went to Strout and whispered something
to him.</p>

<p>Strout nodded, and turning to the company said, "As
it's now half past 'leven and most time for honest folks to
be abed and rogues a runnin', out of compliment to Miss
Huldy's grandpa and grandma, who have honored us with
their presence this evenin', we will close these festivities
with a good old-fashioned heel and toe Virginia reel.
Let 'er go, Abner, and keep her up till all the fiddle strings
are busted."</p>

<p>Like trained soldiers, they sprang to their places. Quincy
and his partner took places near the end of the line. He
explained to her that he had never danced a reel, but<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>thought he could easily learn from seeing the others, and
he told her that when their turn came she need not fear
but that he would do his part.</p>

<p>The Deacon and his wife led off, and their performance
caused great enthusiasm. Sam Hill was not a good dancer,
so he resigned Miss Tilly James to Professor Strout. Miss
James was a superb dancer, and as Quincy looked at her
his face showed his appreciation.</p>

<p>His partner saw the glance, and looking up to him said,
"Don't you wish you could dance as well as that?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could," said Quincy. "I have no doubt you
can," he added, looking at his partner's rosy face.</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "you do the best you can, and I'll do
the same."</p>

<p>Professor Strout and Tilly did finely, and their performance
gained them an encore, which they granted. One by
one the couples went under the arch of extended arms,
and one by one they showed their Terpsichorean agility
on the kitchen floor, over which Mandy Skinner had
thoughtfully sprinkled a handful of house sand.</p>

<p>At last came the turn of Quincy and his little partner,
whose name was unknown to him. He observed the grace
with which she went through the march, and when the
dance came be wished he could have stood still and
watched her. Instead, he entered with his whole soul into
the dance, and at its conclusion he was astonished to hear
the burst of applause and cheers that fell upon his ears.</p>

<p>"Come along!" said his partner, and taking him by the
hand she drew him back through the arch, and the dance
was repeated.</p>

<p>Three times in succession was this done in response to
enthusiastic applause, and Quincy was beginning to think
that he would soon fall in his tracks. He had no idea that
any such fate would befall his partner, for she seemed equal
to an indefinite number of repetitions.</p><p><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a></p>

<p>But, as has been said before, to all good things an end
must come at last, and when the old-fashioned Connecticut
clock on the mantelpiece clanged out the midnight hour, as
if by magic a hush came over the company and the jollities
came to an end. Then followed a rush for capes, and coats,
and jackets, and shawls, and hats. Then came good-byes
and good-nights, and then the girls all kissed Huldy and
her mother, wished them long life and happiness, while
their escorts stood quietly by thinking of the pleasant
homeward trips, and knowing in their hearts that they
should treasure more the pressure of the hand or the single
good-night kiss yet to come than they did the surprise
party kisses that had been theirs during the evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason and 'Zekiel had prepared Alice for her
homeward trip. Quincy took occasion to seek out his partner
in the reel to say good night, and as he shook hands
with her he said, "Would you consider me rude if I asked
your name and who taught you to dance?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no," she replied; "my name is Bessie Chisholm. I
teach the dancing school at Eastborough Centre, and Mr.
Stiles always plays for me."</p>

<p>"Is he going to see you home to-night?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh! no," said she; "I came with my brother. Here,
Sylvester," cried she, and a smart-looking, country fellow,
apparently about twenty-one years of age, came towards
them. "I'm ready," said Bessie to him, and then, turning
to Quincy, "Mr. Sawyer, make you acquainted with my
brother, Sylvester Chisholm."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know my name," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I guess everybody in Eastborough knows who you are,"
retorted she with a toss of her head, as she took her brother's
arm and walked away.</p>

<p>Hiram had brought 'round the Pettengill sleigh from the
barn. 'Zekiel, Alice, Quincy, and Mandy were the last of
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>the party to leave. Quincy took his old place beside Alice,
while Mandy sat on the front seat with 'Zekiel.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night and the ride home was
a most enjoyable one.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Quincy to Alice, "that you could not
take part in more of the games. I enjoyed them very
much."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Mason kept me informed of your actions,"
said Alice with a laugh.</p>

<p>Halfway to Hill's grocery they passed the Professor and
Abner walking home to Mrs. Hawkins's boarding house.
They called out, "Good night and pleasant dreams," and
drove rapidly on. In the Square a number of the party
had stopped to say good night again before taking the
various roads that diverged from it, and another interchange
of "Good nights" followed.</p>

<p>When Strout and Abner reached the Square it was deserted.
There was no light shining in the boarding house.
The kerosene lamps and matches were on a table in the
front entry. Strout lighted his lamp and went upstairs.
Strout's room was one flight up, while Abner's was up two.
As they reached Strout's room he said, "Come in, Abner,
and warm up. Comin' out of that hot room into this cold
air has given me a chill." He went to a closet and brought
out a bottle, a small pitcher, and a couple of spoons. "Have
some rum and molasses, nothin' better for a cold."</p>

<p>They mixed their drinks in a couple of tumblers, which
Strout found in the closet. Then he took a couple of cigars
from his pocket and gave one to Abner. They drank and
smoked for some time in silence.</p>

<p>At last Abner said, "How are you satisfied with this
evenin's perceedin's?"</p>

<p>"Wall, all things considered," said Strout, "I think it was
the most successful party ever given in this 'ere town, if I
did do it."</p><p><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a></p>

<p>"That's so," responded Abner sententiously. "Warn't
you a bit struck up when that city feller come in?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Strout. "You know when I come back,
you see it was so cussed hot, yer know I said it was the
heat, but I knew they wuz there. Mrs. Mason, told me."</p>

<p>"Did she?" asked Abner, with wide-opened eyes. "I
thought it was one on you."</p>

<p>"When I went down to the road before the bugle was
blown," said Strout, "Mrs. Mason told me they was there.
You see, Huldy didn't suspect nothin' about the party and
so she asked them over to tea. She sorter expected they
would go right after tea, but they got singin' songs and
tellin' stories, and Huldy saw they had come to stay."</p>

<p>"But," said Abner, "that city feller must have known
all about it aforehand or how could he git that cake and
frozen stuff down from Bosting so quick?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you say," said Strout, "that you seen them going
over to Eastborough Centre about five o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Abner, "but how did he know when it
was? Some one must have told him, I guess."</p>

<p>"There are times, Abner Stiles," exclaimed Strout, "when
you are too almighty inquisitive."</p>

<p>"Wall, I only wanted to know, so I could tell the truth
when folks asked me," said Abner.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Strout. "Cuddent you guess who
told him? 'Twas that Hiram Maxwell. I've been pumping
him about the city chap, and of course, I've had to tell him
somethin' for swaps. But to-morrow when I meet him
I'll tell him I don't want anythin' more to do with a tittle-tattle
tell-tale like him."</p>

<p>"What d'ye think of that pome 'bout the bumblebee?"
drawled Abner.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was a put-up job," said Strout.</p>

<p>"How could that be?" asked Abner, "when you took it
out of your own box?"</p><p><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></p>

<p>"Well," rejoined Strout, "he'll find I'm the wustest kind
of a bumblebee if he stirs me up much more. When my
dander's up a hornet's nest ain't a patch to me."</p>

<p>"I kinder fancied," continued Abner, "that the reason
he had them fancy boxes sent down was because he sorter
thought our pound packages would be rather ornary."</p>

<p>"I guess you've hit it 'bout right," remarked Strout;
"them city swells would cheat their tailor so as to make a
splurge and show how much money they've got. I guess
he thought as how I'd never seen ice cream, but I showed
him I knew all about it. I eat three sasserful myself."</p>

<p>"I beat you on that," said Abner; "I eat a sasserful of
each kind."</p>

<p>As Abner finished speaking he emptied his glass and
then reached forward for the bottle in order to replenish
it. Strout's glass was also empty, and being much nearer
to the bottle than Abner was, he had it in his possession
before Abner could reach it. When he put it down again
it was beyond his companion's reach. Abner turned some
molasses into has tumbler, and then said, "Don't you think
'twas purty plucky of that city feller to come to our party
to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Strout, "he jest sneaked in with 'Zeke
Pettengill and his sister. He'll find out that I'm no slouch
here in Eastborough. When I marry the Deacon's daughter
and git the Deacon's money, and am elected tax collector
agin, and buy the grocery store, and I'm app'inted postmaster
at Mason's Corner, he'll diskiver that it's harder
fightin' facts like them than it is Bob Wood's fists. I kinder
reckon there won't be anybody that won't take off their
hats to me, and there won't be any doubts as to who runs
this 'ere town. That city feller's health will improve right
off, and he'll go up to Boston a wiser man than when he
come down."</p>

<p>"That's so," remarked Abner; and as he spoke he stood
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>up as if to emphasize his words. Before he sat down, however,
he reached across the table for the bottle, but again
Strout was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"I was only goin' to drink yer health an' success to yer,"
said Abner.</p>

<p>"All right," said Strout, "make it half a glass and I'll
jine yer."</p>

<p>The two men clinked their glasses, drank, and smacked
their lips.</p>

<p>"If you don't go to bed now you won't git up till to-morrer,"
said the Professor.</p>

<p>"Yer mean ter-day," chuckled Abner, as he got up and
walked 'round to the other side of the table, where he had
left his lamp.</p>

<p>"I guess," remarked Strout, "I'll have some more fire.
I ain't goin' to bed jest yet. I've got some heavy thinkin'
to do."</p>

<p>While he was upon his knees arranging the wood, starting
up the embers with the bellows, Abner reached across
the table and got possession of his tumbler, from which he
had fortunately removed the spoon. Grasping the bottle
he filled it to the brim and tossed it down in three big
swallows. As he replaced the tumbler on the table, Strout
turned round.</p>

<p>"There was 'bout a spoonful left in the bottom of my
tumbler," said Abner, apologetically. "Them that drinks
last drinks best," said he, as he took up his lamp. "I guess
that nightcap won't hurt me," he muttered to himself as he
stumbled up the flight of stairs that led to his room.</p>

<p>The fire burned brightly and Strout resumed his seat
and drew the bottle towards him. He lifted it up and
looked at it.</p>

<p>"The skunk!" said he half aloud; "a man that'll steal
rum will hook money next. Wall, it won't be many days
before that city chap will buy his return ticket to Boston.<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>
Then I shan't have any further use for Abner. Let me
see," he soliloquized, "what I've got to do to-morrer? Git
the Deacon's money at ten, propose to Huldy 'bout half
past, git home to dinner at twelve, buy the grocery store
'bout quarter-past three; that'll be a pretty good day's
work!"</p>

<p>Then the Professor mixed up a nightcap for himself and
was soon sleeping soundly, regardless of the broad smile
upon the face of the Man in the Moon, who looked down
upon the town with an expression that seemed to indicate
that he considered himself the biggest man in it.</p><p><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a></p>

<h3>TOWN POLITICS.<br /></h3>

<p>At the table next morning the conversation was all about
the surprise party. The Cobb twins declared that
without exception it was the best party that had ever been
given at Mason's Corner, to their knowledge.</p>

<p>After breakfast Quincy told Ezekiel that he was going
over to Eastborough Centre that morning; in fact, he should
like the single horse and team for the next three days,
as he had considerable business to attend to.</p>

<p>He drove first to the office of the express company; but
to his great disappointment he was informed that no package
had arrived for him on the morning train. Thinking
that possibly some explanation of the failure of the bank
to comply with his wishes might have been sent by mail,
he went to the post office; there he found a letter from the
cashier of his bank, informing him that he had taken the
liberty to send him enclosed, instead of the five hundred
dollars in bills, his own check certified for that amount, and
stated that the local bank would undoubtedly cash the
same for him.</p>

<p>As he turned to leave the post office he met Sylvester
Chisholm. Quincy greeted the young man pleasantly, and
asked him if he were in business at the Centre. Sylvester
replied that he was the compositor and local newsman on
the "Eastborough Express," a weekly newspaper issued
every Friday. The bank being located in the same building,
Quincy drove him over. Sylvester asked Quincy if he
would not step in and look at their office. Quincy did so.
A man about thirty years of age arose from a chair and
<a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>stepped forward as they entered, saying, "Hello, Chisholm,
I have been waiting nearly half an hour for you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleby, Mr. Sawyer," said Sylvester, introducing
the two men.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleby occupies a similar position on the 'Montrose
Messenger' to the one that I hold on the 'Eastborough
Express,'" said Sylvester, by way of explanation to
Quincy. "We exchange items; that is, he supplies me with
items relating to Montrose that are supposed to be interesting
to the inhabitants of Eastborough, and I return the
compliment. Here are your items," said Sylvester, passing
an envelope to Mr. Appleby.</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby seemed to be in great haste, and with a
short "Good morning" left the office.</p>

<p>"He is a great friend of Professor Strout's," remarked
Sylvester.</p>

<p>"You speak as though you were not," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Sylvester, "I used to think a good deal
more of him at one time than I do now, not on account of
anything that he has done to me, but I do not think he has
treated one of my dearest friends just right. Did you hear
anything, Mr. Sawyer, about his being engaged or likely
to be engaged to Deacon Mason's daughter, Huldy?"</p>

<p>Quincy looked at Sylvester and then laughed outright.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't heard of any such thing," he replied,
"and considering certain information that I have in my
mind and which I know to be correct, I do not think I ever
shall."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what that information is?" asked Sylvester.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I will," said Quincy, "if you will inform
me why you wish to know."</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is," remarked Sylvester, "that for quite a
while Professor Strout and my sister Bessie, whom you saw
last night at the party and with whom you danced, kept
company together, and everybody over here to the Centre
<a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>thought that they would be engaged and get married one
of these days; but since that concert at the Town Hall,
where you sang, a change of mind seems to have come over
the Professor, and he has not seen my sister except when
they met by accident. She thinks a good deal of him still,
and although the man has done me no harm personally, of
course I do not feel very good toward the fellow who makes
my sister feel unhappy."</p>

<p>"Now," said Quincy, "what I am going to say I am
going to tell you for your personal benefit and not for publication.
I happen to know that Miss Huldy Mason is engaged
definitely to Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill, and has been
for some time. Now, promise me not to put that in your
paper."</p>

<p>"I promise," said Sylvester, "unless I obtain the same information
from some other source."</p>

<p>"All right," rejoined Quincy, and shaking hands with
the young man he crossed the passageway and went into
the bank.</p>

<p>He presented his certified check, and the five hundred
dollars in bills were passed to him, and he placed them in
his inside coat pocket. He was turning to leave the bank
when he met Deacon Mason just entering.</p>

<p>"Ah, Deacon," said he, "have you come to draw some
money? I think I have just taken all the bank bills they
have on hand."</p>

<p>"I hope not," said the Deacon, "I kinder promised some
one that I'd be on hand about noon to-day with five hundred
dollars that he wants to use on a business matter this afternoon."</p>

<p>Quincy took the Deacon by the arm and pulled him one
side, out of hearing of any other person in the room.</p>

<p>"Say, Deacon Mason, I am going to ask you a question,
which, of course, you can answer or not, as you see fit; but
if this business matter turns out to be what I think it is, I
may be able to save you considerable trouble."</p><p><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></p>

<p>"I don't think you would ask me any question that I
ought not to answer," replied the Deacon, glancing up at
Quincy with a sly look in his eye and a slight smile on his
face.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Quincy, "are you going to let Strout
have that money to pay down on account of the grocery
store?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the Deacon, "I guess you have hit it
about right. Strout seemed to think that there warn't
any doubt but what he could get the store, but as he said
the town clerk was willing to endorse his note, I came over
here last night just on purpose to find that out. I kinder
thought I was perfectly safe in letting him have the money."</p>

<p>"Oh, you would be all right, Deacon, financially, if the
town clerk or any other good man endorsed his note; but
you see Strout won't need the money. I happen to know
of another man that is going to bid on that grocery store.
How much money do you think Strout can command; how
high will he bid?"</p>

<p>"Well, he told me," the Deacon answered, "that he had
parties that would back him up to the extent of two thousand
dollars, and this five hundred dollars that I was goin'
to lend him would make twenty-five hundred, and he had
sort o' figured that the whole place, including the land and
buildings and stock, warn't wuth any more than that, and
that Benoni Hill would be mighty glad to get such a good
offer."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Quincy, "but I happen to know
a man that's going to bid on that grocery store and he will
have it if he has to bid as high as five thousand dollars, and
he is ready to put down the solid cash for it without any
notes."</p>

<p>The Deacon glanced up at Quincy, and the sly look in his
eye was more pronounced than ever, while the smile on his
face very much resembled a grin.</p>

<p>"I guess it must be some outside feller that is a-going to
<a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>buy it then," said the Deacon, "for I don't believe there is
a man in Eastborough that would put up five thousand dollars
in cold cash for that grocery store, unless he considered
that he was paying for something besides groceries
when he bought it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think, Deacon," continued Quincy, "that
we need go further into particulars; I think we understand
each other; all is, you come up to the auction this afternoon,
and if the place is knocked down to Strout I will let you
have the five hundred dollars that I have here in my pocket;
besides, it would have been poor business policy for you to
let him have the money on that note before the sale; for
if the store was not sold to him you could not get back your
money until the note became due."</p>

<p>"That's so," assented the Deacon. "Well, I've got to
get home, cuz I promised to meet him by twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"So have I," said Quincy, "for I have got to see the man
who is going to buy the grocery store and fix up a few business
matters with him."</p>

<p>Both men left the bank and got into their respective
teams, which were standing in front of the building.</p>

<p>"Which road are you going, Deacon?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Waal, I guess, for appearance's sake, Mr. Sawyer, you
better go on the straight road, while I'll take the curved
one. Yer know the curved one leads right up to my barn
door."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Quincy, "I found that out last
night;" and the two men parted.</p>

<p>Quincy made quick time on his homeward trip. As he
neared the Pettengill house he saw Cobb's twins and Hiram
standing in front of the barn. He drove up and threw the
reins to Bill Cobb, saying, "I shall want the team again
right after dinner;" and turning to Hiram, be said, "Come
down to Jacob's Parlor, I want to have a little talk with
you."</p>

<p>They entered the large wood shed that Ezekiel's father
<a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>had called by the quaint name just referred to, and took
their old seats, Quincy in the armchair and Hiram on the
chopping block facing him. Hiram looked towards the
stove and Quincy said, "It is not very cold this morning, I
don't think we shall need a fire; besides, what I have got to
say will take but a short time. Now, young man," continued
he, "how old did you say you were?"</p>

<p>"I am about thirty," replied Hiram.</p>

<p>"You are about thirty?" repeated Quincy, "and yet you
are satisfied to stay with Deacon Mason and do his odd jobs
for about ten dollars a month and your board, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't a mean man," said Hiram, "he gives me
ten dollars a month and my board, and two suits of clothes
a year, including shoes and hats."</p>

<p>"Have you no ambition to do any better?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Ambition?" cried Hiram, "why I'm full of it. I've
thought of more than a dozen different kinds of business
that I would like to go into and work day and night to
make my fortune, but what can a feller do if he hasn't any
capital and hasn't got any backer?"</p>

<p>"Well, the best thing that you can do, Hiram, is to find a
partner; that's what people do when they have no money;
they look around and find somebody who has."</p>

<p>"You mean," said Hiram, "that I've got to look 'round
and find some one who has got some money, who's willin' to
let me have part of it. There's lots of fellers in Eastborough
that have got money, but they hang to it tighter'n the
bark to a tree."</p>

<p>"And yet," said Quincy, "a man like Obadiah Strout
can go around this town and get parties to back him up to
the extent of twenty-five hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered Hiram, "but he couldn't do
that if the parties didn't have a mortgage on the place, and
o' course if Strout can't keep up his payments they'll grab
the store and get the hull business. I happen to know that
one of the parties that's goin' to put his name on one of<a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>
Strout's notes said quietly to another party that told a
feller that I heerd it from that it wouldn't be more'n a year
afore he'd be runnin' that grocery store himself."</p>

<p>"Well, Hiram Maxwell, I've got some money that I am
not using just now. You know that I've got quite a large
account to settle with that Professor Strout, and I can afford
to pay pretty handsomely to get even with him. Now
do you think if you had that grocery store that you could
make a success of it?"</p>

<p>"Could I?" cried Hiram, "waal, I know I could. I know
every man, woman, and child in this town, and there isn't
one of them that's got anythin' agin me that I knows of."</p>

<p>"I'd back you up," said Quincy, "but I've got something
against you, and I will not agree to put my money into that
store until you explain to me something that you told me
several weeks ago. I don't say but that you told me the
truth as far as it went, but you didn't tell me the whole
truth, and that's what I find fault with you for."</p>

<p>Hiram's eyes had dilated, and he looked at Quincy with a
wild glance of astonishment. Could he believe his ears?
Here was this young man, a millionaire's son, saying that
he would have backed him up in business but for the fact
that he had told him a wrong story. Hiram scratched his
head and looked perplexed.</p>

<p>"True as I live, Mr. Sawyer, I don't remember ever
tellin' you a lie since I've known yer. I may have added
a little somethin' to some of my stories that I have brought
inter yer, jest to make them a little more interesting and
p'r'aps ter satisfy a little pussonal spite that I might have
agin some o' the parties that I was tellin' yer about, but I
know as well's I'm standin' here that I never told yer
nothin' in the way of a lie to work yer any injury. You've
alwus treated me white, and if there's one thing that Mandy
Skinner says she can't abear, it's a man that tells lies."</p>

<p>"Then," remarked Quincy with a smile, "you think a
good deal of Miss Mandy Skinner's opinion?"</p><p><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a></p>

<p>"I ain't never seen any girl whose opinion I think more
of," answered Hiram.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see any girl that you thought more of?"
continued Quincy.</p>

<p>"Waal, I guess it's an open secret 'round town," said
Hiram, "that I'd marry her quicker'n lightnin', if she'd
have me."</p>

<p>"Well, why won't she have you?" persisted Quincy.</p>

<p>"That's easy to answer," said Hiram. "You stated the
situation purty plainly yourself when you counted up my
income, ten dollars a month and my food and two suits of
clothes. How could I pervide for Mandy out o'
that?"</p>

<p>"Well," asked Quincy, "supposing I bought that grocery
store for you and you got along well and made money.
Do you think Mandy would consent to become Mrs. Maxwell?"</p>

<p>"I can't say for sure, Mr. Sawyer, but I think Miss Mandy
Skinner would be at a loss for any good reason for refusin'
me, in case what you jest talked about come to pass," said
Hiram.</p>

<p>"Now," proceeded Quincy, "we will settle that little matter
that I referred to a short time ago. You remember you
were telling me your war experiences. You said you were
never shot, but that you were hit with a fence rail at the
battle of Cedar Mountain."</p>

<p>"Waal, I guess if you git my war record you will find
I didn't tell yer any lie about that."</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Quincy, "that's all right; but why didn't
you tell me that on one occasion, when the captain of your
company was shot down, together with half the attacking
force, that you took his body on your back and bore him
off the field, at the same time sounding the retreat with
your bugle? Why didn't you tell me that on two separate
occasions, when the color sergeants of your company were
<a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>shot and the flag fell from their grasp, that you took the
flag and bore it forward, sounding the charge, until you
were relieved of your double duty? In other words, when
there were so many good things that you could say for
yourself, why didn't you say them?"</p>

<p>Hiram thought for a moment and then he said, "Waal,
I didn't think that I had any right to interduce outside matters
not connected with what we were talkin' about. You
asked me if I'd ever been shot, and I told yer how I got
hit; but I didn't consider the luggin' the cap'n off the field
or h'istin' Old Glory, when there wasn't anybody else to
attend to it jest that minute, come under the head of bein'
shot."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed outright and extended his hand, which
Hiram took. Quincy gave it a hearty shake and said,
"Hiram, I think you're all right. I've decided to buy that
grocery store for you for two reasons. The first is that
you have served me well; Mandy has been very kind and
attentive to me, and I want to see you both prosper and be
happy. My second reason relates to the Professor, and,
of course, does not need any explanation, so far as you're
concerned. Now, you go up to the house, put on your best
suit of clothes, tell the Deacon that I want your company
this afternoon; I will drive up your way about two o'clock,
and we will go to the auction."</p>

<p>While these events were taking place, others, perhaps
equally interesting, were transpiring in another part of
Mason's Corner. The Professor had not arisen until late,
but ten o'clock found him dressed in his best and surveying
his personal appearance with a pleased expression. He
felt that this was a day big with the fate of Professor Strout
and Mason's Corner!</p>

<p>When he left Mrs. Hawkins's boarding house he went
straight to Deacon Mason's.</p>

<p>"Is the Deacon in?" he asked, as pleasant-faced Mrs.
Mason opened the door.</p><p><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a></p>

<p>"No, he has gone over to the Centre. He said he'd got
to go to the bank to get some money for somebody, but
that he'd be back 'tween 'leven and twelve."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Strout, stepping inside the
door; "is Miss Huldy in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's in the parlor; she went in to practise on her
music lesson, but I guess she's reading a book instead, for
I haven't heard the piano since she went in half an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"Waal, I'll step in and have a little chat with her whilst
I'm waiting for the Deacon," said the Professor; "but you
just let me know as soon as the Deacon comes, won't you,
Mrs. Mason?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mason replied that she would, and the Professor
opened the parlor door and stepped in.</p>

<p>"Oh, good morning, Miss Mason," said the Professor; "I
hope I see you enjoying your usual good health after last
evening's excitement."</p>

<p>Huldy arose and shook hands with the Professor.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said she, "I got up a little late this morning,
but I never felt better in my life. It was very kind of
you, Mr. Strout, and of my other friends, to show your appreciation
in such a pleasant manner, and I shall never forget
your kindness."</p>

<p>"Waal, you know, I've always taken a great interest in
you, Miss Mason."</p>

<p>"I know you have in my singing," answered Huldy, "and
I know that I have improved a great deal since you have
been giving me lessons."</p>

<p>"But I don't refer wholly to your singin'," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean my playing," remarked Huldy. "Well,
I don't know that I shall ever be a brilliant performer on
the piano, but I must acknowledge that you have been the
cause of my improving in that respect also."</p>

<p>"Waal, I don't mean," continued the Professor, "jest
<a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>your singin' and your playin'. I've been interested in you
as a whole."</p>

<p>"I don't exactly see what you mean by that, Mr. Strout,
unless you mean my ability as a housekeeper. I am afraid
if you ask my mother, she will not give me a very flattering
recommendation."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know enough about housekeepin' to satisfy
me," said the Professor.</p>

<p>Huldy by this time divined what was on the Professor's
mind; in fact, she had known it for some time, but had assured
herself that he would never have the courage to put
his hints, and suggestions, and allusions, into an actual declaration.
So she replied with some asperity, "What made
you think I was looking for a situation as housekeeper?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothin'," said he, "I wasn't thinkin' anythin' about
what I thought you thought, but I was a-thinkin' about
somethin' that I thought myself."</p>

<p>Huldy looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"What would you say," asked the Professor, "if I told
you that I thought of gettin' married?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Huldy, "I think my first question would
be, 'have you asked her?'"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't yet," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"Well, then, my advice to you," continued Huldy, "is
don't delay; if you do perhaps some other fellow may ask
her first, and she may consent, not knowing that you think
so much of her."</p>

<p>"Well, I've thought of that," said the Professor. "I
guess you're right. What would you say," continued he,
"if I told you that I had asked her?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say," answered Huldy, "that you told
me only a minute or two ago that you hadn't."</p>

<p>"Well, I hadn't then," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"I don't really see how you have had any chance to ask
her, as you say you have," remarked Huldy, "in the short
<a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>time that has passed since you said you hadn't. I am
not very quick at seeing a joke, Professor, but p'raps
I can understand what you mean, if you will tell me when
you asked her, and where you asked her to marry you."</p>

<p>"Just now! Right here!" cried the Professor; and before
Huldy could interpose he had arisen from his chair and
had fallen on his knees before her.</p>

<p>Huldy looked at him with a startled expression, then as
the whole matter dawned upon her she burst into a loud
laugh. The Professor looked up with a grieved expression
on his face. Huldy became grave instantly.</p>

<p>"I wasn't laughing at you, Professor. I'm sure I'm
grateful for your esteem and friendship, but it never entered
my head till this moment that you had any idea of
asking me to be your wife. What made you think such a
thing possible?"</p>

<p>The Professor was quite portly, and it was with some
little difficulty that he regained his feet, and his face was
rather red with the exertion when he had succeeded.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said he, "I never thought much about
it till that city feller came down here to board; then the
whole town knew that you and 'Zeke Pettengill had had a
fallin' out, and then by and by that city feller who was
boardin' with your folks went away, and I kinder thought
that as you didn't have any steady feller&mdash;"</p>

<p>Huldy broke in,&mdash;"You thought I was in the market
again and that your chances were as good as those of any
one else?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's jest it," said the Professor. "You put it jest
as I would have said it, if you hadn't said it fust."</p>

<p>"Well, really, Professor, I can't understand what gave
you and the whole town the idea that there was any falling
out between Mr. Pettengill and myself. We have grown
up together, we have always loved each other very much,
and we have been engaged to be married&mdash;"</p><p><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a></p>

<p>"Since when?" broke in the Professor, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Since the day before I last engaged you to give me
music lessons," replied Huldy.</p>

<p>What the Professor would have said in reply to this will
never be known; for at that moment Mrs. Mason opened
the door, and looking in, said, "The Deacon's come."</p>

<p>Strout grasped his hat, and with a hurried bow and
"Good morning" to Huldy, left the room, closing the door
behind him. It must be said for the Professor that he bore
defeat with great equanimity, and when he reached the
great kitchen and shook hands with Deacon Mason, who
had just come in from the barn, the casual observer would
have noticed nothing peculiar in his expression.</p>

<p>"Waal, Deacon," said he in a low tone, "did you git the
money?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've 'ranged 'bout the money," said the Deacon;
"but I had a talk with my lawyer, and he said it wasn't
good bizness for me to pay over the five hundred dollars
till the store was actually knocked down to you. Here's
that note of yourn that the town clerk endorsed las' night.
Neow, when the auctioneer says the store is yourn I'll give
yer the five hundred dollars and take the note. I'll be up
to the auction by half-past two, so you needn't worry, it'll
be jest the same as though yer had the money in yer hand."</p>

<p>Strout looked a little disturbed; but thinking the matter
over quickly, he decided that he had nothing to gain by
arguing the question with the Deacon; so saying, "Be sure
and be on hand, Deacon, for it's a sure thing my gettin'
that store, if I have the cash to pay down," he left the house.</p>

<p>He went up the hill and turned the corner on the way
back to his boarding house. When he got out of sight of
the Deacon's house he stopped, clenched his hands, shut his
teeth firmly together and stamped his foot on the ground;
then he ejaculated in a savage whisper, "Women are
wussern catamounts; you know which way a catamount's
<a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>goin' to jump. I wonder whether she was honest about
that, or whether she's been foolin' me all this time; she'll
be a sorry girl when I git that store and 'lected tax collector,
and git app'inted postmaster. I've got three tricks
left, ef I have lost two. I wonder who it was put that idea
into the Deacon's head not ter let me have thet money till
the sale was over. I bet a dollar it wuz thet city feller.
Abner says thet he met Appleby on his way back to Montrose,
and he told him thet he saw thet city feller and the
Deacon drive off tergether from front o' the bank. Oh!
nonsense, what would the son of a millionaire want of a
grocery store in a little country town like this?" and he
went into his boarding house to dinner.</p>

<p>A few moments after two o'clock Strout could restrain
his impatience no longer, and leaving his boarding house
he walked over to the grocery store. Quite a number of
the Mason's Corner people were gathered in the Square, for
to them an auction sale was as good as a show. Quincy
had not arrived, and the Professor tried to quiet his nerves
by walking up and down the platform and smoking a cigar.
The crowd gradually increased, quite a number coming in
teams from Montrose and from Eastborough Centre. One
of the teams from Montrose brought the auctioneer, Mr.
Beers, with whom Strout was acquainted. He gave the
auctioneer a cigar, and they walked up and down the platform
smoking and talking about everything else but the
auction sale. It was a matter of professional dignity with
Mr. Barnabas Beers, auctioneer, not to be on too friendly
terms with bidders before an auction. He had found that
it had detracted from his importance and had lowered bids,
if he allowed would be purchasers to converse with him
concerning the articles to be sold. It was their business,
he maintained in a heated argument one evening in the
hotel at Montrose, to find out by personal inspection the
condition and value of what was to be sold, and it was his
<a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>business, he said, to know as little about it as possible, for
the less he knew the less it would interfere with his descriptive
powers when, hammer in hand, he took his position on
the bench. Having established a professional standing,
Barnabas Beers was not a man to step down, and though
the Professor, after a while, endeavored to extract some
information from the auctioneer as to whether there was
likely to be many bidders, he finally gave it up in despair,
for he found Mr. Beers as uncommunicative as a hitching
post, as he afterwards told Abner Stiles.</p>

<p>About half-past two Deacon Mason drove into the
Square, and the Professor went to meet him, and shook
hands with him. In a short time his other backers, who had
agreed to endorse his notes to the amount of two thousand
dollars, arrived upon the scene, and he took occasion to
welcome them in a manner that could not escape the attention
of the crowd. It was now ten minutes of three, and the
auctioneer stepped upon the temporary platform that had
been erected for him, and bringing his hammer down upon
the head of a barrel that had been placed in front of him,
he read, in a loud voice, which reached every portion of
the Square, the printed notice that for several weeks had
hung upon the fences, sheds, and trees of Mason's Corner,
Eastborough Centre, West Eastborough, and Montrose.</p>

<p>It was now three o'clock, for that hour was rung out by
the bell on the Rev. Caleb Howe's church. The auctioneer
prefaced his inquiry for bids by the usual grandiloquence
in use by members of that fraternity, closing his oration
with that often-heard remark, "How much am I offered?"</p>

<p>The Professor, who was standing by the side of Deacon
Mason's team, called out in a loud voice, "Fifteen hundred!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take that just for a starter," said the auctioneer,
"but of course no sane man not fitted to be the inmate
of an idiotic asylum thinks that this fine piece of ground,
this long-built and long-established grocery store, filled to
overflowing with all the necessities and delicacies of the
<a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>season, a store which has been in successful operation for
nearly forty years, and of which the good will is worth a
good deal more than the sum just bid, will be sold for any
such preposterous figure! Gentlemen, I am listening."</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice from the rear of the crowd called out,
"T-o-o-t-o to to-oo-two thousand!"</p>

<p>As if by magic, every head was turned, for the majority
of those in the crowd recognized the voice at once. There
was but one man in Mason's Corner who stammered, and
that man was Hiram Maxwell.</p>

<p>They turned, and all saw seated in the Pettengill team
Hiram Maxwell, and beside him sat Mr. Sawyer from
Boston.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's more like it," said the auctioneer. "Competition
is the life of trade, and is particularly pleasing to an
auctioneer. The first gentleman who bid now sees that
there is another gentleman who has a better knowledge of
the value of this fine property than he has evinced up to
the present moment. There is still an opportunity for
him to see the error of his ways, and put himself on record
as being an observing and intelligent person."</p>

<p>All eyes were turned upon Strout at these words from
the auctioneer; his face reddened, and he called out,
"Twenty-five hundred!"</p>

<p>"Still better," cried the auctioneer; "the gentleman, as I
supposed, has shown that he is a person of discernment; he
did not imagine that I was engaged simply to make a present
of this fine establishment to any one who would offer
any sum that suited his convenience for it. He knew as
well as I did that there would be a sharp contest to secure
this fine property. Now, gentlemen, I am offered twenty-five
hundred, twenty-five hundred I am offered, twenty-five
hundred&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again a voice was heard from the team on the outer
limits of the crowd, "Twenty-five fifty!"</p>

<p>The crowd again turned their gaze upon Strout; the<a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>
Professor was not an extravagant man, and he had saved
a little money. He had in his pocket at the time a little
over a hundred dollars; he would not put it in the bank,
for, he argued, if he did everybody in town would know
how much money he had; so he called out, "Twenty-six
hundred!"</p>

<p>"Ah, gentlemen," continued the auctioneer, "let me
thank you for the keen appreciation that you show of a
good thing. When I looked this property over I said
to myself, the bidders will tumble over themselves to secure
this fine property'; and I have not been disappointed."</p>

<p>Again the faces of the crowd were turned towards the
team in which sat Quincy and Hiram. Hiram stood up in
the team, and masking a horn with his hands, shouted at the
top of his voice, for the time overcoming his propensity to
stammer, "Twenty-seven hundred!"</p>

<p>"Better! still better!" cried the auctioneer; "we are now
approaching the figure that I had placed on this property,
and my judgment is usually correct. I am offered twenty-seven
hundred, twenty-seven hundred; who will go one
hundred better?"</p>

<p>At this moment Abner Stiles, who had been watching the
proceedings with eyes distended and mouth wide open,
went up to Strout and whispered something in his ear.
Strout's face brightened, he grasped Abner's hand and
shook it warmly, then turning towards the auctioneer cried
out, "Twenty-eight hundred!"</p>

<p>By this time the crowd was getting excited. To them it
was a battle royal; nothing of the kind had ever been seen
at Mason's Corner before. A great many in the crowd
were friends of Strout's, and admired his pluck in standing
out so well. They had seen at a glance that Abner Stiles
had offered to help Strout.</p>

<p>Again the auctioneer called out in his parrot-like tone,
"Twenty-eight hundred! I am offered twenty-eight hundred!"</p><p><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></p>

<p>And again Hiram put his hands to his mouth, and his
voice was heard over the Square as he said, "Three thousand!"</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," continued the auctioneer, "I am
proud to be with you. When it is my misfortune to stand
up before a company, the members of which have no appreciation
of the value of the property to be sold, I often wish
myself at home; but, as I said before, on this occasion I am
proud to be with you, for a sum approximating to the true
value of the property offered for sale has been bidden. I
am offered three thousand&mdash;three thousand&mdash;three thousand&mdash;going
at three thousand! Did I hear a bid? No,
it must have been the wind whistling through the trees."
At this sally a laugh came up from the crowd. "Going at
three thousand&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;going&mdash;gone at three
thousand to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hiram Maxwell!" came from the score of voices.</p>

<p>"Gone at three thousand to Mr. Hiram Maxwell!" said
the auctioneer, as he brought down his hammer heavily
upon the barrel head with such force that it fell in, and,
losing his hold upon the hammer, that dropped in also.
This slight accident caused a great laugh among the crowd.</p>

<p>The auctioneer continued, "According to the terms of
the sale, five hundred dollars in cash must be paid down to
bind the bargain, and the balance must be paid within
three days in endorsed notes satisfactory to the present
owner."</p>

<p>Quincy and Hiram alighted from the Pettengill team
and advanced towards the auctioneer. Reaching the platform,
Quincy took from his pocket a large wallet and passed
a pile of bills to the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Make out a receipt, please," he said to Mr. Beers, "in
the name of Mr. Hiram Maxwell; the notes will be made
out by him and endorsed by me. If you will give a discount
of six per cent, Mr. Maxwell will pay the entire sum
<a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>in cash within ten days; whichever proposition is accepted
by Mr. Hill will be satisfactory to Mr. Maxwell."</p>

<p>The show was over and the company began to disperse.
Deacon Mason nodded to Strout and turned his horse's
head homeward. While Quincy and Hiram were settling
their business matters with the auctioneer, everybody had
left the Square with the exception of a few loungers about
the platform of the grocery store, and Strout and Abner,
who stood near the big tree in the centre of the Square,
talking earnestly to each other.</p>

<p>The auctioneer, together with Quincy and Hiram, entered
the store to talk over business matters with Mr. Hill
and his son. Mr. Hill argued that Mr. Sawyer was good
for any sum, and he would just as soon have the notes; in
fact, he would prefer to have them, rather than make any
discount.</p>

<p>This matter being adjusted, Mr. Hill treated the party
to some of his best cigars, which he kept under the counter
in a private box, and when Quincy and Hiram came out and
took their seats in the team, they looked about the Square
and found that the Professor and his best friend were not
in sight.</p>

<p>The next morning at about nine o'clock, Abbott Smith
arrived at Pettengill's, having with him Mr. Wallace Stackpole.
Quincy was ready for the trip, and they started immediately
for Eastborough Centre. On the way Quincy had
plenty of time for conversation with Mr. Stackpole. The
latter gave a true account of the cause that had led to his
losing his election as tax collector at the town meeting a
year before. He had been taken sick on the train while
coming from Boston, and a kind passenger had given him
a drink of brandy. He acknowledged that he took too
much, and that he really was unable to walk when he
reached the station at Eastborough Centre; but he said
that he was not a drinking man, and would not have taken
the brandy if he had not been sick. They reached Eastborough<a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>
Centre in due season, but made no stop, continuing
on to West Eastborough to the home of Abbott
Smith's father.</p>

<p>Here Quincy was introduced to 'Bias Smith, and found
that what had been said about him was not overstated. He
was a tall, heavily-built man, with a hard, rugged face, but
with a pleasant and powerful countenance, and, in the
course of conversation, ran the whole gamut of oratorical
expression. He was what New England country towns
have so often produced&mdash;a natural-born orator. In addition
he was an up-to-date man. He was well read in history,
and kept a close eye on current political events, including
not only local matters, but State and National affairs
as well.</p>

<p>Quincy gave him Strout's war record that he had obtained
from the Adjutant-General's office, and it was read
over and compared with that of Wallace Stackpole, which
was also in 'Bias Smith's possession. Mr. Stackpole had
obtained from the town clerk a statement of taxes due and
collected for the past twenty years, and this was also delivered
to Mr. Smith. Quincy confided to Mr. Smith several
matters that he wished attended to in town meeting,
and the latter agreed to present them, as requested.</p>

<p>It was finally settled that 'Bias Smith and Mr. Stackpole
should come over to Mason's Corner the following Saturday
and see if Deacon Mason would agree to act as moderator
at the annual town meeting on the following Monday,
the warrants for same having already been posted.</p>

<p>When Quincy reached home he found Hiram waiting
for him. They went in to Jacob's Parlor and took their
accustomed seats.</p>

<p>"Any news?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said Hiram, "neither Strout or Abner
have been seen on the street sence the sale wuz over, but
Strout has got hold of it in some way that Huldy's engaged
to 'Zeke Pettengill, and it's all over town."</p><p><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a></p>

<p>At that moment Ezekiel opened the door and stepped
into the shed. There was a roguish twinkle in his eye and
a smile about his lips as he advanced towards Quincy.</p>

<p>"Waal, the cat's out o' the bag," said he to Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hiram was just telling me that Strout got hold of
it in some way."</p>

<p>"Yaas," said Ezekiel, "he got hold of it in the most direct
way that he possibly could."</p>

<p>"How's that," asked Quincy, "did Miss Mason tell him?"</p>

<p>"Yaas," said Ezekiel, "he seemed to want a satisfactory
reason why she couldn't marry him, and it sorter seemed
to her that the best reason that she could give him was that
she was engaged to marry me."</p>

<p>Hiram nearly lost his seat on the chopping block while
expressing his delight, and on Quincy's face there was a
look of quiet satisfaction that indicated that he was quite
well satisfied with the present condition of affairs.</p>

<p>"By the way, Hiram," said Quincy, "I believe you told
me once that Mrs. Hawkins, who keeps the house where
the Professor boards, is Mandy Skinner's mother."</p>

<p>"Yaas," said Hiram, "Mandy's father died and her mother
married Jonas Hawkins. He wasn't much account afore
he was married, but I understand that he has turned out
to be a rale handy man 'round the boardin' house. Mrs.
Hawkins's a mighty smart woman, and she knew just what
kind of a man she wanted."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I want you to tell Mandy to see
her mother as soon as she can, and engage the best room
that she has left in the house for a gentleman that I expect
down here from Boston next Monday night. Here's ten
dollars, and have Mandy tell her that this is her week's
pay in advance for room and board, counting from to-day."</p>

<p>"Waal, I don't believe she'll take it," said Hiram; "she's
a mighty smart woman and mighty clus in money matters,
but she's no skin, and I don't believe she'll take ten dollars
for one week's board and room."</p><p><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a></p>

<p>"Well, if she won't take it," remarked Quincy, "Mandy
may have the balance of it for her trouble. The man wants
the room, and he is able to pay for it."</p>

<p>Then Quincy and Ezekiel went into the house for supper.</p>

<p>The next morning Quincy found that Uncle Ike had not
forgotten his promise, for he was on hand promptly, dressed
for a trip to Eastborough Centre. This time they took the
carryall and two horses, and Uncle Ike sat on the front
seat with Quincy.</p>

<p>They reached Eastborough Centre and found Dr. Tillotson
awaiting them. The return home was quickly made
and Uncle Ike took the doctor to the parlor. Then he
went to Alice's room, and Quincy heard them descend the
stairs. The conversation lasted for a full hour, and Quincy
sat in his room thinking and hoping for the best. Suddenly
he was startled from his reveries by a rap upon the door,
and Uncle Ike said the doctor was ready. Quincy drove
him back to Eastborough Centre, and on the way the doctor
gave him his diagnosis of the case and his proposed treatment.
He said it would not be necessary for him to see her
again for three weeks, or until the medicine that he had left
for her was gone. He would come down again at a day's
notice from Quincy.</p>

<p>On his return Mandy told him that Miss Alice was in
the parlor and would like to see him. As he entered the
room she recognized his footstep, and starting to her feet
turned towards him. He advanced to meet her and took
both her hands in his.</p>

<p>"How can I thank you, my good friend," said she, "for
the interest that you have taken in me, and how can I repay
you for the money that you have spent?"</p>

<p>Quincy was at first disposed to deny his connection with
the matter, but thinking that Uncle Ike must have told of
it, he said, "I don't think it was quite fair for Uncle Ike,
after promising to keep silent!"</p>

<p>"It was not Uncle Ike's fault," broke in Alice; "it was
<a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>nobody's fault. Nobody had told the doctor that there was
any secret about it, and so he spoke freely of your visit to
the city, and of what you had said, and of the arrangements
that you had made to have the treatment continued as long
as it produced satisfactory results. But," continued Alice,
"how can I ever pay you this great sum of money that it
will cost for my treatment?"</p>

<p>"Do not worry about that, Alice," said he, using her
Christian name for the second time, "the money is nothing.
I have more than I know what to do with, and it is a pleasure
for me to use it in this way, if it will be of any benefit
to you. You can repay me at any time. You will get
money from your poems and your stories in due time, and
I shall not have to suffer if I have to wait a long time for
it. God knows, Alice," and her name fell from his lips as
though he had always called her by that name, "that if
half, or even the whole of my fortune would give you back
your sight, I would give it to you willingly. Do you believe
me?" And he took her hands again in his.</p>

<p>"I believe you," she said simply.</p>

<p>At that moment Mandy appeared at the door with the
familiar cry, "Supper's ready," and Quincy led Alice to
her old place at the table and took his seat at her side.</p><p><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a></p>

<h3>THE TOWN MEETING.<br /></h3>

<p>The next day was Friday. After breakfast Quincy
went to his room and looked over the memorandum
pad upon which he had taken pleasure in jotting down the
various items of his campaign against the singing-master.
As he looked at the pad he checked off the items that he
had attended to, but suddenly started back with an expression
of disgust.</p>

<p>"Confound it," said he, "I neglected to telegraph to those
congressmen when I was at Eastborough Centre last Tuesday.
I hope I'm not too late." He reflected for a moment,
then said to himself, "No, it's all right; this is the long
session, and my friends will be in Washington."</p>

<p>He immediately wrote two letters to his Congressional
friends, stating that he had good reasons for having the
appointment of Obadiah Strout as postmaster at Mason's
Corner, Mass., held up for a week.</p>

<p>"At the end of that time," he wrote, "I will either withdraw
my objections or present them in detail, accompanied
by affidavits in opposition to the appointment."</p>

<p>Having finished the letters, he went downstairs to the
kitchen, and, as usual, found Hiram engaged in conversation
with Mandy.</p>

<p>"You are just the man I want," said he to Hiram; "I
would like to have you take these letters to the Mason's
Corner post office and mail them at once. You can tell Mr.
Hill that the papers relating to the store are nearly ready,
and if he and his son will come here this afternoon we will
<a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>execute them. I would like to have you and Mr. Pettengill
on hand as witnesses."</p>

<p>Hiram started off on his mission, and Quincy returned to
his room and busied himself with the preparation of the
documents for the transfer of the grocery store, and the
making out of the necessary notes to cover the twenty-five
hundred dollars due for the same.</p>

<p>He had not seen Alice at breakfast, nor did she appear
at the dinner table. He had followed the rule since she
came to the house not to make any open inquiries about her
health, but from words dropped by Ezekiel and Uncle Ike,
he had kept fairly well informed as to the result of her
treatment. At dinner Ezekiel remarked that his sister
had commenced to take her new medicine, and that he
reckoned it must be purty powerful, for she had said that
she didn't wish anything to eat, and didn't want anything
sent to her room.</p>

<p>Quincy politely expressed his regrets at her indisposition
and trusted that she would soon be able to join them again
at meal time.</p>

<p>About three o'clock in the afternoon, Samuel Hill and
his father arrived, and Hiram, remembering Quincy's instructions,
had found Ezekiel Pettengill, and all came to the
room together. It took a comparatively short time to
sign, seal, and deliver the documents and papers. It was
arranged that Samuel Hill and his father should take
charge of the grocery store and carry on the business until
a week from the following Monday; as Quincy told young
Hill that he had some business to attend to the early part
of the following week that would prevent his giving any
attention to the store until the latter part of the week.</p>

<p>Quincy treated his principals and witnesses to cigars, and
an interchange of ideas was made in relation to the result
of the auction sale.</p>

<p>"How does Strout take it?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," spoke up Hiram. "He acts as though
<a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>he thought I was pizen. Every time he sees me he crosses
over on t'other side of the street, if we happen to be comin'
towards each other."</p>

<p>"Well, I imagine," said Quincy, "that your usefulness
to him has departed in some respects, but it's just as well."</p>

<p>"Well," said young Hill, "I can tell you what he said
the other night in the grocery store. There was a crowd
of his friends there, and he remarked that you," turning to
Quincy, "might own Hill's grocery store, but that wasn't
the whole earth. He said that he had no doubt that he
would be elected unanimously as tax collector, and he was
sure of his appointment as postmaster, and if he got it he
should start another grocery store on his own hook and
make it lively for you."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy with a laugh, "competition is the
life of trade, and I sha'n't object if he does go into the business;
but if he does, I will guarantee to undersell him on
every article, and I will put on a couple of teams and hire
a couple of men, and we'll scour Eastborough and Mason's
Corner and Montrose for orders in the morning, and then
we'll deliver all the goods by team in the afternoon in
regular Boston style. I never knew just exactly what I
was cut out for. I know I don't like studying law, and it
may be, after all, that it's my destiny to become a grocery-man."</p>

<p>Quincy took Ezekiel by the arm, led him to the window,
and whispered something to him.</p>

<p>Ezekiel laughed, then turned red in the face, then finally
said in an undertone, "Waal, I dunno, seems kinder early,
but I dunno but it jest as well might be then as any other
time. I hain't got nuthin' ter do this afternoon, so I think
I'll take a walk up there to see how the land lays."</p>

<p>He said, "Good afternoon" to the others and left the
room.</p>

<p>Quincy then took Samuel Hill by the arm in the same
manner as he had done to Ezekiel, led him to the window,
<a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>and said something to him which wrought a similar effect
to that produced upon Ezekiel.</p>

<p>Samuel thought for a moment and then said, "That ain't
a bad idea; I'm satisfied if the other party is. I'm going
to drive over this afternoon and tell the old gentleman that
matters are all fixed up, and I'll find out if there's any objection
to the plan. Guess I'll go now, as I've got to git
back to-night."</p>

<p>So he said "Good afternoon," and, accompanied by his
father, took his departure.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Hiram," said Quincy, "I want to have a talk
with you. Have you settled up that little matter with
Mandy?"</p>

<p>"No," said Hiram, "not yet; I've ben tryin' to muster
up courage, but I haven't ben able to up to the present
moment."</p>

<p>"I should think," remarked Quincy, "that a man who
had carried his captain off the field with a shower of bullets
raining about him, or who had pushed forward with his
country's flag in the face of a similar storm of bullets,
ought not to be afraid to ask a young girl to marry him."</p>

<p>"Waal, do yer know," said Hiram, "I'm more afraid o'
Mandy than I would be of the whole army."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I don't see any other way for you
except to walk up like a man and meet your fate. Of course
if I could do it for you I'd be willing to oblige you."</p>

<p>"No, thank yer," said Hiram, "I kinder reckon thet little
matter had better be settled between the two principals in
the case without callin' in a lawyer."</p>

<p>Quincy leaned over and whispered something to him.</p>

<p>"By crickey!" said Hiram, "what put thet idea inter yer
head?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Quincy, "since I've had to spend so much
time plotting against my enemies, I've got into the habit of
thinking out little surprises for my friends."</p>

<p>"Waal, I swan!" cried Hiram, "that would be the biggest
<a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>thing ever happened in Mason's Corner. Well, I rather
think I shall be able to tend to that matter now, at once.
One, two, three," said Hiram, "just think of it; well, that's
the biggest lark that I've ever ben connected with; beats
buying the grocery store all holler."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Quincy, "you three gentlemen understand
it now, and if matters can be arranged I will do
my part, and I promise you all a grand send-off; but not a
word of it must be breathed to outside parties, remember.
It won't amount to anything unless its' a big surprise."</p>

<p>"All right," said Hiram, "I kinder reckon Sawyer's surprise
party will be a bigger one than Strout's was."</p>

<p>"Oh," continued Hiram, "I 'most forgot. Mandy was
up ter see her mother abeout thet room for thet man that's
comin' down from Boston Monday night, and Mis' Hawkins
says the price of the room is three dollars per week
and the board fifty cents a day. Mandy paid for the room
for a week, and Mis' Hawkins says after she takes out what
the board comes to she'll give the balance back ter Mandy."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Quincy, "I've heard from the
man in Boston, and he'll surely occupy the room next
Monday night. Mandy can tell her mother to have it all
ready."</p>

<p>Next morning about ten o'clock, Abbott Smith drove
over from Eastborough Centre, accompanied by his father
and Wallace Stackpole. Quincy took his place beside Mr.
Stackpole on the rear seat of the carryall, and Abbott drove
off as though he intended to return to Eastborough Centre,
but when he reached the crossroad he went through, then
turning back towards Mason's Corner, drove on until he
reached Deacon Mason's barn, following the same plan that
Ezekiel had on the night of the surprise party.</p>

<p>They found the Deacon at home, and all adjourned to
the parlor, where 'Bias Smith stated his business, which
was to ask the Deacon to act as Moderator at the town
meeting on the following Monday. The Deacon objected
<a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>at first, but finally consented, after Mr. Smith had explained
several matters to him.</p>

<p>"Yer know," said the Deacon, "my fellow citizens have
tried on several occasions to have me run for selectman,
but I reckoned thet I wuz too old to be out so late nights
and have to drive home from Eastborough at ten or 'leven
o'clock at night. Besides I've worked hard in my day,
and there's no place I like so well as my own home. I'm
alwus sorry to go away in the mornin' and alwus glad ter
git home at night, and although I consider that every citizen
ought ter do everything he can for the public good, I
reckon thet there's a good many more anxious than I am
to serve the town, and I'm not so consated but thet I think
they know how ter do it better'n I could. But as that
Moderator work comes in the daytime, as I stand ready to
do all I can for my young friend here," turning towards
Quincy, "I'll be on hand Monday mornin' and do the best
I can to serve public and private interests at the same
time."</p>

<p>Wallace Stackpole, while the others were talking, had
taken a couple of newspapers from his pocket, and as Deacon
Mason finished, he looted up and said, "There's an
item here in the 'Eastborough Express,' Deacon, that I
imagine you'll be interested in. I'll read it to you: 'We are
informed on the best authority that Miss Huldy Mason,
only daughter of Deacon Abraham Mason of Mason's Corner,
is engaged to Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill. The day of the
marriage has not been fixed, but our readers will be informed
in due season.'"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, Deacon," said Quincy, "that's all my fault.
I met young Chisholm last Tuesday when I was over to the
Centre, and he told me something that actually obliged me
to confide in him the fact that I knew that your daughter
was not likely to become Mrs. Obadiah Strout, but he
promised me on his word of honor that he would not put it
<a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>in the paper unless he got the same information from some
other source."</p>

<p>The Deacon haw-hawed in good old-fashioned country
style.</p>

<p>"Waal," said he, "young Chisholm tackled me, and said
he heard a rumor abeout Huldy and Strout, and, as you say,
Mr. Sawyer, he kinder 'bliged me to set him right. But
he made me a promise, as he did you, thet he wouldn't say
anythin' abeout it unless some other feller told him the
same thing."</p>

<p>"That young man is sure to get ahead in the world; he
buncoed us both, Deacon," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Waal, I dunno as I know just what you mean by buncoed,"
said the Deacon, "but I kinder think he got the best
of both on us on thet point."</p>

<p>As they took their places again in the carryall, Quincy
said to Mr. Smith, "If you can drive to Mr. Pettengill's
house and wait a few minutes, I think I'll go over to Eastborough
Centre with you. I'm going to Boston this afternoon,
and shall not be back again until Monday night."</p>

<p>This they consented to do, and after Quincy had obtained
certain papers and had packed his travelling bag, he left
word with Mandy that he would not be back to the house
until Tuesday of the following week, and it might be
Wednesday, as he was going to Boston to see his parents.</p>

<p>When they reached Eastborough Centre, Quincy went at
once to the post office; there he found a short letter from
Leopold Ernst. It read as follows:</p>

<p>"Dear Q:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come up and see me as soon as you can; I shall be at
home all day Sunday. Am ready to report on the stories,
but have more to say than I have time to write.</p>

<p class="right3">
Invariably thine,</p>
<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Leopold Ernst</span>."
</p><p><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a></p>

<p>Quincy then crossed the Square and entered the office of
the "Eastborough Express." Sylvester flushed a little as
Quincy came in, but the latter reassured him by extending
his hand and shaking it heartily.</p>

<p>"Is the editor in?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Sylvester, "he never shows up on Saturdays."</p>

<p>"Who is going to report the town meeting?" continued
Quincy.</p>

<p>"I am," answered Sylvester. "The editor will be on
hand, but he told me yesterday that he should depend on
me to write the meeting up, because he had a little political
work to attend to that would take all his time. He told
me he was going over to see 'Bias Smith on Sunday, so I
imagine that Mr. Smith and he are interested on the same
side."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Chisholm," said Quincy, "you managed that
little matter about Miss Mason's engagement so neatly that
I have something for you to do for me. I'm going to Boston
this afternoon, and shall not be back until half-past
seven Monday night. I'm going over to see Mr. Parsons
when I leave here, and shall arrange with him to supply all
our boys with all they want to eat and drink next Monday."</p>

<p>"Well, the boys, as you call them, will be pretty apt to
be hungry and thirsty next Monday," laughed Sylvester.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Quincy, "I'll stand the bills."</p>

<p>"How's Parsons going to know which are our boys?"
continued Chisholm. "They ought to have some kind of
badge or some kind of a password, or your enemies, as well
as your friends, will be eating up your provisions."</p>

<p>"That's what I want you to attend to," added Quincy.
"I'll arrange with Parsons that if anybody gives him the
letters B D on the quiet, he is to consider that they are on
our side, and mustn't take any money from them, but chalk
it up on my score. Now, I depend upon you, Mr. Chisholm,
<a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>to give the password to the faithful, and to pay you
for your time and trouble just take this."</p>

<p>And he passed a twenty-dollar bill to Sylvester. The
latter drew back.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Sawyer," said he, "I cannot take any money for
that service. This work is to be done, for I understand
the whole business, to defeat the man who, I think, has
treated my sister in a very mean manner, and I'm willing
to work all day and all night without any pay to knock
that fellow out. Let's put it that way,&mdash;I'm working against
him, and not for you; and, looking at it that way, of course,
there's no reason why you should pay me anything."</p>

<p>"All right," rejoined Quincy, "I should have no feeling
if you took the money, but I can appreciate your sentiments,
and will have no feeling because you do not take
it. One of these days I may be able to do as great a service
for you, as you are willing to do for me between now
and next Monday."</p>

<p>They shook hands and parted, and Quincy made his way
to the Eagle Hotel, of which Mr. Seth Parsons was the
proprietor. Mr. Parsons greeted him heartily and invited
him into his private room. Here Quincy told the arrangement
that he had made with young Chisholm, and gave
him the password.</p>

<p>"Don't stint them," said Quincy, "let them have a good
time; but don't let anybody know who pays for it. I shall
be down on the half-past seven express, Monday night, and
I would like to have a nice little dinner for eight or nine
people ready in your private dining-room at eight o'clock.
Mr. Tobias Smith knows who my guests are to be, and if I
am delayed from any cause, he will tell you who are entitled
to go in and eat the dinner."</p>

<p>The next train to Boston was due in ten minutes, and
shaking hands with the hotel proprietor, he made his way
quickly to the station. As he reached the platform he noticed
that Abner Stiles was just driving away; the thought
<a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a>flashed through his mind that somebody from Mason's Corner
was going to the city; but that was no uncommon event,
and the thought passed from him.</p>

<p>He entered the car, and, to his surprise, found that it
was filled; every seat in sight was taken. He walked forward
and espied a seat near the farther end of the car. He
noticed that a lady sat near the window; when he reached
it he raised his hat, and leaning forward, said politely, "Is
this seat taken?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied a pleasant, but somewhat sad voice,
and he sank into the seat without further thought as to its
other occupant.</p>

<p>When they reached the first station beyond Eastborough
Centre he glanced out of the window, and as he did so,
noticed that his companion was Miss Lindy Putnam.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Putnam," cried he, turning towards her,
"how could I be so ungallant as not to recognize you?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Lindy, "perhaps it's just as well that you
didn't; my thoughts were not very pleasant, and I should
not have been a very entertaining companion."</p>

<p>"More trouble at home?" he inquired in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Lindy, in a choked voice, "since Mr.
Putnam died it has been worse than ever. While he lived
she had him to talk to; but now she insists on talking to me,
and sends for me several times a day, ostensibly to do something
for her, but really simply to get me in the room so
she can talk over the old, old story, and say spiteful and
hateful things to me. May Heaven pardon me for saying
so, Mr. Sawyer, but I am thankful that it's nearly at an
end."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean," asked Quincy, "is she worse?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lindy, "she is failing very rapidly physically,
but her voice and mental powers are as strong as ever; in
fact, I think she is more acute in her mind and sharper in
her words than she has ever been before. Dr. Budd ordered
some medicine that I could not get at the Centre, and so
<a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>there was no way for me except to go to the city for it.
Let me tell you now, Mr. Sawyer, something that I should
have been obliged to write to you, if I had not seen you.
I shall stay with Mrs. Putnam until she dies, for I promised
Jones that I would, and I could never break any promise
that I made to him; but the very moment that she's dead
I shall leave the house and the town forever!"</p>

<p>"Shall you not stay to the funeral?" said Quincy; "what
will the townspeople say?"</p>

<p>"I don't care what they say," rejoined Lindy, in a sharp
tone; "she is not my mother, and I will not stay to the
funeral and hypocritically mourn over her, when in my
secret heart I shall be glad she is dead."</p>

<p>"Those are harsh words," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Not one-tenth nor one-hundredth as harsh and unfeeling
as those she has used to me," said Lindy. "No, my mind
is made up; my trunks are all packed, and she will not be
able to lock me in my room this time. I shall leave town
by the first train after her death, and Eastborough will
never see me nor hear from me again."</p>

<p>"But how about your friends," asked Quincy, "supposing
that I should find out something that would be of interest
to you; supposing that I should get some information
that might lead to the discovery of your real parents, how
could I find you?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Lindy, "if you will give me your promise
that you will not disclose to any one what I am going to
say, I will tell you how to find me."</p>

<p>"You have my word," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Lindy, "I'm going to New York! I
would tell you where, but I don't know. But if you wish
to find me at any time advertise in the Personal Column of
the 'New York Herald'; address it to Linda, and sign it
Eastborough," said she, after a moment's thought. "I shall
drop the name of Putnam when I arrive in New York, but
what name I shall take I have not yet decided upon; it will
<a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>depend upon circumstances. But I shall have the 'New
York Herald' every day, and if you advertise for me I
shall be sure to see it."</p>

<p>She then relapsed into silence, and Quincy forbore to
speak any more, as he saw she was busy with her own
thoughts. They soon reached the city and parted at the
door of the station. She gave him her hand, and as he held
it in his for a moment, he said, "Good-by, Miss Linda."
She thanked him for not saying "Miss Putnam" with a
glance of her eyes. "I may not see you again, but you may
depend upon me. If I hear of anything that will help you
in your search for your parents, my time shall be given to
the matter, and I will communicate with you at the earliest
moment. Good-by."</p>

<p>He raised his hat and they parted.</p>

<p>Town Meeting Day proved to be a bright and pleasant
one. At nine o'clock the Town Hall was filled with the
citizens of Eastborough. They had come from the Centre,
they had come from West Eastborough and from Mason's
Corner. There were very nearly four hundred gathered
upon the floor, the majority of them being horny-handed
sons of toil, or, more properly speaking, independent New
England farmers.</p>

<p>When Jeremiah Spinney, the oldest man in town, who
had reached the age of ninety-two, and who declared that
he hadn't "missed a town meetin' for seventy year," called
the meeting to order, a hush fell upon the assemblage. In
a cracked, but still distinct voice, he called for a nomination
for Moderator of the meeting. Abraham Mason's name,
of Mason's Corner, was the only one presented. The choice
was by acclamation; for it was acknowledged on all sides
that Deacon Mason was as square a man as there was in
town.</p>

<p>The newly-elected Moderator took the chair and called
upon the clerk to read the warrant for the meeting. This
was soon done, and the transaction of the town's business
<a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>begun in earnest. It will be, of course, impossible and unnecessary
to give a complete and connected account of all
that took place in town meeting on that day. For such an
account the trader is referred to the columns of the "Eastborough
Express," for it was afterwards acknowledged on
all sides that the account of the meeting written by Mr.
Sylvester Chisholm was the most graphic and comprehensive
that had ever appeared in that paper. We have to do
only with those items in the warrant that related directly
or indirectly to those residents of the town with whom we
are interested.</p>

<p>When the question of appropriating a certain sum for
the support of the town Almshouse was reached, Obadiah
Strout sprang to his feet and called out, "Mister Moderator,"
in a loud voice. He was recognized, and addressed
the chair as follows:</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator, before a vote is taken on the questions
of appropriatin' for the support of the town poor, I
wish to call the attention of my fellow-citizens to a matter
that has come to my knowledge durin' the past year. A
short time ago a man who had been a town charge for more
than three years, and whose funeral expenses were paid by
the town, was discovered by me to be the only brother of
a man livin' in Boston, who is said to be worth a million
dollars. A very strange circumstance was that the son of
this wealthy man, and a nephew of this town pauper, has
been livin' in this town for several months, and spendin'
his money in every way that he could think of to attract
attention, but it never occurred to him that he could have
used his money to better advantage if he had taken some of
it and paid it to the town for takin' care of his uncle.
These facts are well known to many of us here, and I move
that a ballot&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tobias Smith had been fidgeting uneasily in his seat
while Strout was speaking, and when he mentioned the
word "ballot," he could restrain himself no longer, but
<a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>jumped to Bids feet and called out in his stentorian voice,
"Mister Moderator, I rise to a question of privilege."</p>

<p>"I have the floor," shouted Strout, "and I wish to finish
my remarks. This is only an attempt of the opposition to
shut me off. I demand to be heard!"</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," screamed Abner Stiles, "I move
that Mr. Strout be allowed to continue without further
interruption."</p>

<p>The Moderator brought his gavel down on the table and
called out, "Order, order." Then turning to Tobias, he
said, "Mr. Smith, state your question of privilege."</p>

<p>Strout sank into his seat, his face livid with passion;
turning to Stiles, he said, "This is all cooked up between
'em. You know you told me you saw Smith and Stackpole
and that city chap drivin' away from the Deacon's
house last Saturday mornin'."</p>

<p>Stiles nodded his head and said, "I guess you're right."</p>

<p>Mr. Smith continued, "My question of privilege, Mister
Moderator, is this: I desire to present it now, because when
I've stated it, my fellow citizen," turning to Strout, "will
find that it's unnecessary to make any motion in relation
to the matter to which he has referred. I hold in my hand
a letter from Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer, whose father is
the Hon. Nathaniel Sawyer of Boston, and whose uncle was
Mr. James Sawyer, who died in the Eastborough Poorhouse
several weeks ago. By conference with Mr. Waters,
who is in charge of the Poorhouse, and with the Town
Treasurer, he ascertained that the total expense to which
the town of Eastborough has been put for the care of his
uncle was four hundred and sixty-eight dollars and
seventy-two cents. I hold his check for that sum, drawn to
the order of the Town Treasurer, and certified to be good
by the cashier of the Eastborough National Bank. He has
requested me to offer this check to the town, and that a
receipt for the same be given by the Town Treasurer."</p>

<p>Strout jumped to his feet.</p><p><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a></p>

<p>"Mister Moderator, I am glad to learn," cried he, "that
this son of a millionaire has had his heart touched and his
conscience pricked by the kindness shown by the town of
Eastborough to his uncle, and I move the check be accepted
and a receipt given by the Town Treasurer, as requested."</p>

<p>"Second the motion!" called out Abner Stiles.</p>

<p>"Before puttin' the question," said the Moderator slowly,
"I want to say a few words on this matter, and as it may be
thought not just proper for me to speak from the chair,
I will call upon the Rev. Caleb Howe to take the same durin'
my remarks."</p>

<p>The well-known clergyman at Mason's Corner came forward,
ascended the platform, took the chair, and recognized
Deacon Mason's claim to be heard.</p>

<p>"I have heerd the motion to accept this check, an' I desire
ter say thet I am teetotally opposed to the town's takin'
this money. If the Honorable Nathaniel Sawyer, who's the
dead man's brother, or Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer, who's
his nephew, had known that he wuz a pauper, they would
'er relieved the town of any further charge. We hev no
legal claim agin either of these two gentlemen. Our claim
is agin ther town of Amesbury, in which Mr. James Sawyer
was a citizen and a taxpayer. If Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer
wishes to pay ther town of Amesbury after ther town
of Amesbury has paid us, thet's his affair and none o' our
business, but we've no legal right to accept a dollar from
him, when our legal claim is agin the town in which he hed
a settlement, and I hope this motion will not prevail."</p>

<p>As Deacon Mason regained the platform loud cries of
"Vote! Vote! Vote!" came from all parts of the hall.</p>

<p>Tellers were appointed, and in a few moments the result
of the vote was announced. In favor of Mr. Strout's motion
to accept the check, eighty-five. Opposed, two hundred
and eighty. And it was not a vote.</p>

<p>"We will now proceed," said the Moderator, as he resumed
<a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>the chair, "to consider the question of appropriating
money for the support of the Poor-farm."</p>

<p>The next matter on the warrant of general interest was
the appropriation of a small sum of money to purchase
some reference books for the town library, which consisted
of but a few hundred volumes stowed away in a badly-lighted
and poorly-ventilated room on the upper floor of
the Town Hall.</p>

<p>This question brought to his feet Zachariah Butterfield,
who was looked upon as the watchdog of the town treasury.
He had not supported Strout on the question of accepting
the check, because he knew the position taken by the Moderator
was legally correct, and he was very careful in opposing
appropriations to attack only those where, as it seemed
to him, he had a good show of carrying his point. He had
been successful so often, that with him success was a duty,
for he had a reputation to maintain.</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," he said, "I'm agin appropriatin' any
more money for this 'ere town lib'ry. We hev got plenty
of schoolbooks in our schools; we hev got plenty of books
and newspapers in our houses, and it's my opinion thet those
people who spend their time crawlin' up three flights er
stairs and readin' those books had better be tillin' ther soil,
poundin' on ther anvil, or catchin fish. Neow, I wuz talkin'
with Miss Burpee, the librari'n, and she sez they want a
new Wooster's Dictshuneery, 'cause ther old one iz all worn
eout. Neow, I looked through the old one, and I couldn't
see but what it's jest as good as ever; there may be a few
pages missin', but what's thet amount ter when there's
more'n a couple of thousan' on 'em left?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tobias Smith was again fidgeting in his seat. He
evidently had something to say and was anxious to say it.</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield continued: "Neow, to settle this question
onct fer all, I make ther motion that this 'ere lib'ry be
closed up and the librari'n discharged; she gits a dollar a
<a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a>week, and ther town ken use that fifty-two dollars a year,
in my opinion, to better advantege."</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," came again from Mr. Tobias Smith,
"I rise to a question of privilege&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield kept on talking: "Mister Moderator, this
is not a question of privilege; this is a question of expenditure
of money for a needless purpose. Yes, Mister Moderator,
for a needless purpose."</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield had evidently lost the thread of his discourse,
and Mr. Smith, taking advantage of his temporary
indecision, said, "I agree with the gentleman who has just
spoken; I am in favor of closing up this musty, dusty old
room, and saving the further expenditure of money upon
it."</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield, hearing these words, and not having sufficiently
collected his thoughts to say anything himself,
nodded approvingly and sank into his seat.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith continued, "I have a proposition to submit in
relation to the town library. I hold in my hand a letter
from Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer, whose name has been
previously mentioned&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Strout jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator, I rise to a question of privilege."</p>

<p>"I second the motion!" cried Abner Stiles.</p>

<p>"State your question of privilege, Mr. Strout," said the
Moderator.</p>

<p>"I wish to inquire," answered Strout, "if the time of
this town meetin' is to be devoted to the legitimate business
of the town, or is it to be fooled away in hearin' letters read
from a person who is not a citizen of the town, and who is
not entitled to be heard in this town meetin'?"</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," said Mr. Smith, "I am a citizen of
this town, and I'm entitled to be heard in this meeting, and
the matter that I'm about to bring to the attention of this
meeting is a most important one and affects the interests of
the town materially. I consider that I have a right to read
<a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a>this letter or any other letter that relates to the question
before the meeting, which is, 'Shall money be appropriated
to buy books for what is called the town library?' I say
NO; and my reason for this is contained in this letter, which
I propose to read."</p>

<p>"Go on, Mr. Smith," said the Moderator.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Mr. Smith, "Mr. Quincy Adams
Sawyer, in this letter, offers to the town of Eastborough
the sum of five thousand dollars, to be used either for purchasing
books and paying the expenses of a library to be
located in the Town Hall; or a portion of the money may
be used to build a suitable building, and the balance for the
equipment and support of the library."</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield was on his feet again.</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator, I'm agin acceptin' this donation. If
we take it, we shall only jump out er the fryin-pan inter
the fire; instead of buyin' a few books and payin' the librari'n
a dollar a week, we shall hev to hev a jan'ter for
the new buildin', and pay fer insurance, and we shell hev
ter hev a librari'n ev'ry day in ther week, and by'm by the
ungodly will want ter hev it open on a Sunday, so thet they
kin hev a place to loaf in; and I'm agin the whole bizness
teetotally. I've sed my say; neow, you kin go ahead, and
do jest as you please."</p>

<p>This was Mr. Butterfield's usual wind-up to his arguments;
but on this occasion it seemed to fail of its effect.</p>

<p>The Moderator said, "Was Mr. Butterfield's motion seconded?"
There was no response. "Then the matter before
the meeting is the question of appropriating money
for the support of the town library."</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," said Mr. Smith, "I move that the
donation from Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer be accepted, and
that the library be named 'The Sawyer Free Public Library
of the Town of Eastborough.'"</p>

<p>"Second the motion!" came from a hundred voices.</p>

<p>Strout was on his feet again.</p><p><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a></p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," said he, "I move to amend the motion
by havin' it read that we decline, that the town declines
the donation without thanks."</p>

<p>A loud laugh arose from the assemblage.</p>

<p>Abner Stiles had evidently misinterpreted Mr. Strout's
motion, for he called out, "Mister Moderator," and when he
got the floor, "I move to amend so that the motion would
read, this library shall be called the Strout Free Library
of the Town of Eastborough."</p>

<p>This was greeted with shouts of laughter, and Strout
grasped Abner by his coat collar and pulled him violently
back upon the settee.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you fool," cried he between his teeth to Abner;
"do you want to make a laughin' stock of me?"</p>

<p>"I kinder thought I wuz a-helpin' yer," said Abner, as
he ran his fingers down under his chin and pulled away his
shirt collar, which had been drawn back so forcibly that it
interfered with his breathing.</p>

<p>"The question now," said the Moderator, "is on the adoption
of Mr. Smith's motion. Those in favor will please stand
up and be counted."</p>

<p>When the tellers had attended to their duty the Moderator
said, "Those opposed will now rise and be counted."</p>

<p>The vote was soon announced. In favor of accepting
the donation, three hundred and one; opposed, fifty-eight.</p>

<p>"It's a vote," declared the Moderator.</p>

<p>A dozen matters of minor importance were quickly disposed
of, and but one remained upon the warrant, with the
exception of the election of town officers. Little squads
of the members were now gathered together talking over
the most important question of the meeting, which was the
election of town officers for the ensuing year. The last
item on the warrant read: "Will the town appropriate
money to buy a new hearse?"</p>

<p>Mr. Butterfield had evidently been holding himself in
<a name="Page_324" id="Page_324"></a>reserve, for he was on his feet in an instant, and he secured
the eye of the Moderator and the floor.</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator," began Mr. Butterfield, "I desire to
raise my voice agin this biznez of unnecessary and unexampled
extravagance. What do we want of a new hearse?
Those who are dead and in the cemetery don't find any
fault with the one we've got, and those who are livin' have
no present use for it, and why should they complain? I
know what this means. This is only an enterin' wedge.
If this 'ere bill passes and we git a new hearse, then it'll be
said thet ther horses don't look as well as the hearse, and
then if ther hearse gits out in ther storm, we shell hev ter
pay money to git it polished up agin, and we who are livin'
will hev to work harder and harder for the benefit of those
who are jest as well satisfied with the old hearse as they
would be with a new one. I move, Mister Moderator, that
instid of buyin' a new hearse, thet ther old one be lengthened
six inches, which ken be done at a slight expense."</p>

<p>Mr. Tobias Smith now took the floor.</p>

<p>"I am glad that my friend has not opposed this measure
entirely, but has provided for my proper exit from this
world when my time comes. I must confess that it has
troubled me a great deal when I have thought about that
hearse. I was born down in the State of Maine, where the
boys and the trees grow up together. I stand six feet two
in my stockings and six feet three with my boots on, and
I haven't looked forward with any pleasure to being carried
to my last resting place in a hearse that was only six
feet long. I second Mr. Butterfield's motion, but move
to amend it by extending the length to seven feet."</p>

<p>The vote was taken, and Mr. Butterfield's motion was
carried by a vote of three hundred and forty to twenty-two.
Mr. Butterfield sank back in his seat with an expression on
his face that seemed to say, "I've done the town some service
to-day."</p>

<p>The Moderator then rose and said, "Fellow-citizens, all
<a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a>the business matters upon the warrant have now been disposed
of. We will now proceed to the election of town
officers for the ensuing year."</p>

<p>Mr. Stackpole rose and called out, "Mister Moderator,
it is now nearly twelve o'clock, and some of us had to leave
home quite early this morning in order to be in time at the
meeting. I move that we adjourn till one o'clock, at which
time balloting for town officers usually commences."</p>

<p>Forty voices cried out, "Second the motion," and although
Strout, Stiles, and several others jumped to their
feet and endeavored to secure the Moderator's eye, the motion
was adopted by an overwhelming vote, and the greater
portion of the members made their way out of the hall and
directed their steps towards the Eagle Hotel, as if the
whole matter had been prearranged. Here, Mr. Parsons,
the proprietor, had set out a most tempting lunch in the
large dining-room, and those who were able to give the
password were admitted to the room, and feasted to their
heart's content.</p>

<p>Abner Stiles, impelled by curiosity, had followed the
party, and had noticed that each one said something to the
proprietor before he was admitted to the dining-room.
Going up to Parsons, he said, "What's goin' on in there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they're having a caucus," replied Mr. Parsons.</p>

<p>"When thet last feller went in," said Abner, "I saw that
the table was all set, and I kinder 'magined they must be
havin' a dinner. I'd kinder like some myself."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry," said Mr. Parsons, "but I cannot accommodate
any more than have already applied. You can
get a lunch over to the railroad station, you know, if you
want one."</p>

<p>"I know," answered Abner, "but I kinder 'magine
they're talkin' over 'lection matters in there, and I'd rather
like ter know what's goin' on."</p><p><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a></p>

<p>"Well, I guess you'll find out when they get back to the
Town Hall," remarked Mr. Parsons; and he stepped forward
to greet three or four other citizens, who leaned over
and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons smiled and nodded, and opening the door
admitted them to the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats all," said Abner, as he went out on the
platform in front of the hotel. "They jest whispered somethin'
to him and he let 'em right in. I kinder think somethin's
goin' on and thet Strout ain't up to it. Guess I'll go
back and tell him," which he proceeded to do.</p>

<p>He found Strout and some sixty or seventy of the citizens
still remaining in the Town Hall, the majority of whom
were eating the luncheons that they had brought with them
from home. Taking Strout aside, Abner confided to him
the intelligence of which he had become possessed.</p>

<p>"'D'yer know what it means?" asked Abner.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Strout, "but I bet a dollar that it's
some of that city chap's doin's. Is he 'round about town
this mornin'?"</p>

<p>"No," said Abner, "he went to Bosting on the same train
with Miss Lindy Putnam, for I fetched her down, and I
saw him git inter the same car with her as I wuz drivin'
off."</p>

<p>One o'clock soon arrived, and the large party that had
regaled themselves with the appetizing viands and non-alcoholic
beverages supplied by mine host of the Eagle
Hotel came back to the Town Hall in the best of spirits.
The majority of them were smoking good cigars, which
had been handed to them by the proprietor, as they passed
from the dining-room.</p>

<p>When asked if there was anything to pay, Mr. Parsons
shook his head and remarked sententiously, "This is not the
only present that the town has received to-day," which was
a delicate way of insinuating the name of the donor of the
feast without actually mentioning it.</p><p><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a></p>

<p>The election of a dozen minor officers calls for no special
attention, except to record the fact that Abner Stiles, who
had cautiously taken a position several settees removed
from Strout, arose as the nominations were made for each
office, and in every case nominated Mr. Obadiah Strout for
the position, and it is needless to add that Mr. Obadiah
Strout had at least one vote for each office in the gift of
the town.</p>

<p>The nomination of a collector of taxes for the town was
finally reached. Abner Stiles was first on his feet, and
being recognized by the Moderator, nominated "Mr. Obadiah
Strout, who had performed the duties of the office so
efficiently during the past year."</p>

<p>Now the battle royal began. Mr. Tobias Smith next
obtained the floor and nominated Mr. Wallace Stackpole.</p>

<p>"In presenting this nomination, Mister Moderator, I do
it out of justice to an old soldier who served the country
faithfully, and who lost the election a year ago on account
of an untrue statement that was widely circulated and
which could not be refuted in time to affect the question of
his election. I hold in my hand three documents. The
first one is a certified copy of the war record of Wallace
Stackpole, who entered one of our regiments of Volunteers
as a private, served throughout the war, and was honorably
discharged with the rank of captain. This record shows
that during his four years of service he was three times
wounded; in one instance so badly that for weeks his life
hung by a thread, and it was only by the most careful treatment
that amputation of his right arm was avoided. I
hold here also the war record of the present incumbent of
the office. From it I learn that he entered the army as a
private and was discharged at the end of two years still
holding the rank of private, and sent home as an invalid.
He is not to blame for this, but inspecting his record I find
that within a month after he joined the army he was detailed
for service in the hospital, and during the two years
<a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a>of his connection with the army he was never engaged in a
single battle, not even in a skirmish."</p>

<p>Cries rose from certain parts of the hall in opposition to
the speaker, and Deacon Mason remarked that while it was
perfectly proper to compare the war records of the two
candidates for the position, it must be borne in mind that
because a man was a soldier, or, rather, because he did a
little more fighting than the other one, was no reason that
he would make a better tax collector.</p>

<p>The Moderator's remarks were greeted with applause,
and Strout's face brightened.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see the Deacon's bound to have fair play,"
said he to an old farmer who sat next to him.</p>

<p>"Waal, I guess you're more liable to git it than you are
disposed to give it," drawled the old farmer, who evidently
was not an adherent of the present incumbent of the office.</p>

<p>Mr. Tobias Smith continued his remarks:</p>

<p>"I acknowledge the correctness of the remarks just made
by our honored Moderator, and desire to say that I hold
in my hand a third document, which is a statement of the
taxes due and collected during the past twenty years by the
different persons who have held the office of tax collector.
I find during nineteen years of that time that the lowest
percentage of taxes left unpaid at the end of the year was
five per cent; the highest percentage during these nineteen
years, and that occurred during the war, was fourteen per
cent; but I find that during the past year only seventy-eight
per cent of the taxes due have been collected, leaving
twenty-two per cent still due the town, and the non-receipt
of this money will seriously hamper the selectmen during
the coming year, unless we choose a man who can give his
entire time to the business and collect the money that is
due. This statement is certified to by the town treasurer,
and I do not suppose that the present incumbent will presume
to question its accuracy."</p>

<p>Strout evidently thought that a further discussion of the
<a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a>matter might work to his still greater disadvantage, for he
leaned over and spoke to one of his adherents, who rose
and said:</p>

<p>"Mister Moderator, this discussion has taken a personal
nature, in which I am not disposed to indulge. I don't
think that anything will be gained by such accusations and
comparisons. It strikes me that the last speaker is trying
to give tit for tat because his candidate lost at the last
election; but I am one of those who believe that criminations
and recriminations avail nothing, and I move that we
proceed to vote at once."</p>

<p>"Second the motion!" screamed Abner Stiles from the
settee on which he had assumed a standing posture.</p>

<p>The vote was taken. Those in favor of Obadiah Strout
being called upon to stand up first, they numbered exactly
one hundred and one. Then those in favor of Wallace
Stackpole were called upon to rise, and they numbered
two hundred and eighty-four; several citizens having put in
an appearance at one o'clock who had not attended the
morning session.</p>

<p>The next matter was the election of the Board of Selectmen;
and the old board was elected by acclamation without
a division. The meeting then adjourned without day.</p>

<p>The five minutes past six train, express from Boston, arrived
on time, and at twenty minutes of eight, Mr. Quincy
Adams Sawyer entered the private dining-room in the
Eagle Hotel. There he found gathered Mr. Tobias Smith,
Mr. Wallace Stackpole, Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill, Mr. Sylvester
Chisholm, and the Board of Selectmen, making the
party of eight which Quincy had mentioned. It was eleven
o'clock before the dinner party broke up, and during that
time Quincy had heard from one or another of the party a
full account of the doings at the town meeting.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that he was satisfied with the results,
but he said nothing to indicate that fact in the presence of
the Board of Selectmen. They were the first to leave, and
<a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a>then there was an opportunity for mutual congratulations
by the remaining members of the party. To these four
should be added Mr. Parsons, the proprietor, upon whose
face rested a broad smile when he presented his bill for the
day's expenses, and the sum was paid by Quincy.</p>

<p>"We had a very pleasant time," remarked Mr. Parsons to
Mr. Sawyer as he bade him good evening.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear it," said Quincy, "and I regret
very much that my business in the city prevented my being
here to enjoy it."</p>

<p>On the way home with Ezekiel they went over the events
of the day again together, and Ezekiel told him many little
points, that for obvious reasons had been omitted at the
dinner party.</p>

<p>Quincy was driven directly to Mrs. Hawkins's boarding
house, for he had explained his programme to Ezekiel. He
turned up his coat collar and pulled his hat down over his
eyes, as he was admitted; and, although Mrs. Hawkins's
eyes were naturally sharp, she did not recognize the late
comer, who proceeded upstairs to his room, which Mrs.
Hawkins informed him was right opposite the head of the
stairs, and there was a light burning in the room and a good
warm fire, and if he needed anything, if he would just call
to her inside of the next ten minutes, she would get it for
him.</p>

<p>Quincy said nothing, but went into his room and shut the
door, and there we will leave him.</p>

<p>As Strout and Abner drove back to Mason's Corner, after
the adjournment of the town meeting, nothing was said for
the first mile of the trip.</p>

<p>Then Abner turned to him and remarked, "You ought
ter be well satisfied with to-day's perceedin's."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" growled Strout.</p>

<p>"Waal, I think the events proved," said Abner, "that
you wuz the most pop'lar man in ther town."</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?" again growled Strout.</p><p><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></p>

<p>"Why," said Abner, "you wuz nominated for every office
in the gift o' ther town, and that's more'n any other feller
could say."</p>

<p>"If you don't shut up," said Strout, "I'll nominate you
for town idyut, and there won't be any use of any one runnin'
agin yer!"</p>

<p>Abner took his reproof meekly. He always did when
Strout spoke to him. No more was said until they reached
home. Strout entered the boarding house and went upstairs
to his room, forgetting that there was a man from
Boston, to arrive late that evening, who was to have the
next room to his.</p>

<p>Abner put up the horse and went home. As he went by
Strout's door, thoughts of the rum and molasses, and the
good cigar that he had enjoyed the night of the surprise
party one week ago went through his mind, and he stopped
before Strout's door and listened attentively, but there was
no sound, and he went upstairs disconsolately, and went to
bed feeling that his confidence in the Professor had been
somewhat diminished by the events of the day.</p><p><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></p>

<h3>MRS. HAWKINS' BOARDING HOUSE.<br /></h3>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins waited patiently until eight o'clock
for the gentleman from Boston to come down to
breakfast. She then waited impatiently from eight o'clock
till nine. During that time she put the breakfast on the
stove to keep it warm, and also made several trips to the
front entry, where she listened to see if she could hear any
signs of movement on the part of her new boarder.</p>

<p>When nine o'clock arrived she could restrain her impatience
no longer, and, going upstairs, she gave a sharp
knock on the door of Quincy's room.</p>

<p>"What is it?" answered a voice, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"It's nine o'clock, and your breakfast's most dried up,"
replied Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>"I don't wish for any breakfast," said the voice within
the room, but in a much pleasanter tone. "What time do
you have dinner?"</p>

<p>"Twelve o'clock," said Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>"All right," answered the voice, cheerfully. "I'll take
my breakfast and dinner together."</p>

<p>"That beats all," said Mrs. Hawkins, as she entered the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"What beats all?" asked Betsy Green, who worked for
Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>"It beats all," repeated Mrs. Hawkins, "how these city
folks can sit up till twelve o'clock at night, and then go without
their breakfast till noontime. I've fixed up somethin'
pretty nice for him, and I don't propose to see it wasted."</p><p><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></p>

<p>"What are you goin' to do with it?" asked Betsy.
"'Twon't keep till to-morrer mornin'."</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to eat it myself," said Mrs. Hawkins. And
suiting the action to the word, she transferred the appetizing
breakfast to the kitchen table, and, taking a seat, began
to devour it.</p>

<p>"Have you seen your sister, Samanthy, lately?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I was up there Sunday evening," replied Betsy, "and
she said Mis' Putnam was failin' very fast. She keeps her
bed all the time now, and Samanthy has to run up and
down stairs, 'bout forty times a day. She won't let Miss
Lindy do a thing for her."</p>

<p>"Well, if I was Lindy," said Mrs. Hawkins, "I wouldn't
do anything for her if she wanted me to. She used to abuse
that child shamefully. Is Miss Lindy goin' to keep house
arter her mother dies?"</p>

<p>"No," said Betsy, "she's got her things all packed up,
and she told Samanthy she should leave town for well and
good as soon as her mother was buried."</p>

<p>"I don't blame her," exclaimed Mrs. Hawkins.
"Where's Samanthy goin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she says she wants to rest awhile afore she goes
anywheres else to live. She's all run down."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps she'll go and stay with yer mother for a while."</p>

<p>"No," said Betsy, "she won't go there."</p>

<p>"Ain't yer mother 'n' her on good terms?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Betsy, "but the four boys send mother
five dollars a month apiece, and us girls give her two dollars
a month apiece, and it's understood that none of us is
to go and loaf 'round at home, 'less we pay our board."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Mrs. Hawkins. "You can tell
Samanthy for me that she can come here and stay a couple
o' weeks with you. Your bed's big enough for two, and I
won't charge her no board if she's willin' to wait on table
<a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"></a>at dinner time. You'll get the benefit of it, ye know,
Betsy, for you kin get the dinner dishes done so much earlier."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, Mrs. Hawkins," said Betsy,
and the conversation lapsed for a moment till she inquired,
"Will your daughter Mandy stay with Mr. Pettengill
arter he marries Huldy Mason?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Mrs. Hawkins. "Mandy says
that Hiram Maxwell is the biggest fool of a man she ever
saw."</p>

<p>"Then she must think a good deal of him," laughed
Betsy.</p>

<p>"Wall, I fancy she does," replied Mrs. Hawkins; "and
I've no objections to him, seein' as that Mr. Sawyer is goin'
to put him inter the grocery store and back him up. But
Mandy says that he won't come to the pi'nt. He hints and
hints and wobbles all 'round the question, but he don't ask
her to marry him right out and out. Mandy says she won't
gin in until he does, for if she does, she says he'll be
chuckin' it at her one of these days that he didn't ask her
to marry him and be sayin' as how she threw herself at
him, but there's too much of the old Job Skinner spirit in
Mandy for her to do anythin' like that."</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Hawkins looked up and saw Hiram
Maxwell standing in the half-open doorway that led into
the wood-shed.</p>

<p>"List'ners never hear any good of themselves," remarked
Mrs. Hawkins, as Hiram advanced into the room.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear nothin'," said Hiram. "I've got too
many things in my head to tell yer to mind any women's
talk," he continued.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Mrs. Hawkins and Betsy simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Well, fust," said Hiram, "early this mornin' your sister
Samanthy," here he looked at Betsy, "came tearin' down<a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"></a>
<a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a>to Deacon Mason's house and said as how Mis' Hepsey
Putnam was powerful bad, and she wanted me to run
down to 'Zeke Pettengill's and have him bring his sister
right up to the house, 'cause Mis' Putnam wanted to see
her afore she died, and the Deacon's wife said as how I
could go up with him and her, and so we druv up, and a
little while ago your sister Samanthy," here he looked at
Betsy again, "asked me if I'd drive over and ask Mis'
Hawkins if you," here he looked at Betsy for the third
time, "could come up and stay with her this arternoon, for
she thinks Mis' Putnam is goin' to die, and she don't want
to be left alone up in that big house."</p>

  </a>
  <p class="caption">An Old-fashioned Husking Bee. (Act III.)&mdash;Penalty of red ear.</p>
</div>

<p>Betsy looked at Mrs. Hawkins inquiringly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins saw the glance and said, "I can't spare
yer till arter dinner, Betsy; say 'bout one o'clock. You
kin go and stay till the fust thing to-morrer mornin'. I
guess I kin manage supper alone."</p>

<p>"Samanthy will be much obleeged, Mis' Hawkins," said
Hiram. "I'll drive right back and tell her, and I'll drive
down agin about one o'clock arter Betsy."</p>

<p>"List'ners get a good p'int now and then," remarked
Hiram to himself. "Now I see what made Mandy so
durned offish. Wall, she won't have any excuse in the
future. I guess I kin ask her a straight question when I
git good and ready, Mother Hawkins." And he struck
the horse such a violent blow with the whip that it required
all his attention for the next few minutes to bring him
down to a trot. When he had done so he had reached his
destination and his resentful feelings had subsided.</p>

<p>After Hiram had gone, Mrs. Hawkins and Betsy busied
themselves getting dinner. Happening to glance out of
the window, the former exclaimed, "Why, there's Jonas,
and what on airth has he got in his hands?"</p>

<p>Betsy ran to the window and looked out.</p>

<p>"I guess it's a head of lettuce," said she.</p><p><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a></p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and Jonas Hawkins
entered, bearing a huge head of lettuce in his hand.</p>

<p>"Wall, Marthy," said Mr. Hawkins, "how did the man
from Bosting like his breakfast? I kalkilated them fresh-laid
eggs would suit him to a T."</p>

<p>"He ain't got up yet," replied Mrs. Hawkins.</p>

<p>"Must have been putty tired," continued Mr. Hawkins.
"I kinder envy him. Do yer know, Marthy, if I wuz rich
I wouldn't 'git up any day till it wuz time to go to bed
agin." And he laughed loudly at his own remark.</p>

<p>"What do yer expect me to do with that head of lettuce?"
asked Mrs. Hawkins with some asperity in her
tone.</p>

<p>"Wall," said Jonas, "I was over to Hill's grocery and
he'd ordered some from Bosting for Mis' Putnam, but she's
too sick to eat 'em, so Sam gave me this one, 'cause we're
putty good customers, you know, and I kalkilated that if
you made up one of them nice chicken salads o' yourn it
might please the new boarder and the old ones too;" and
chuckling to himself he laid the lettuce on the kitchen
table and walked out into the wood-shed. In a few moments
he was vigorously at work chopping wood, whistling
to himself as he worked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hawkins is an awful good-natured man, isn't he?"
asked Betsy.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Hawkins, "he's too all-fired good-natured
for his own good. If I'd known him twenty-five
years ago he'd have money in the bank now. His fust
wife wuz slacker'n dish water. But I guess we've talked
enough for one mornin', Betsy. You jest git that chicken
I boiled and bone it and chop it up, and I'll make the
dressin'."</p>

<p>When twelve o'clock sounded from the bell in the
church tower, dinner was on the table at Mrs. Hawkins's
boarding house. By five minutes past twelve there were
<a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a>fourteen seated at the table, with one vacant chair. Professor
Strout sat at the head of the table. At his left was
Abner Stiles, while Robert Wood sat next to Stiles. The
vacant seat was at the Professor's right hand, and all eyes
were turned toward it, for all had heard of the Boston man
who had arrived the night before, but who, much to their
disappointment, had not appeared at breakfast.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past twelve the door leading into the
dining-room from the front entry was opened quietly, and
the young man who entered, seeing the vacant chair near
the head of the table, took possession of it.</p>

<p>For a moment nobody looked up, each apparently waiting
for some one else to take the initiative.</p>

<p>Quincy, for it was he, broke the silence, and immediately
every face at the table was turned towards him.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Professor?" said he. "Good afternoon,
Mr. Stiles and Mr. Wood. Ah, glad to see you, Mr. Hill,"
he added, as he espied Samuel Hill at the farther end of the
table.</p>

<p>The Professor's face grew crimson, then bright red, and
finally assumed a bluish tinge. Abner sat transfixed. The
others at the table had a charming diversity of expressions
on their faces, ranging from "grave to gay, from lively to
severe." No one at the table enjoyed the situation any
more than Samuel Hill, who was very fond of a joke and
who knew of Quincy's intention to meet his enemy at close
quarters.</p>

<p>For several minutes no one spoke. Betsy flew from one
to the other waiting upon table, but a solemn hush seemed
to have fallen upon the dinner party. Again Quincy broke
the silence.</p>

<p>"I trust, gentlemen," said he, "that you will not let my
presence interfere with your usual conversation. I have
no doubt Mr. Stiles can tell us a good story, and I am
<a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"></a>equally sure that Professor Strout has some entertaining
bit of village gossip that he would like to circulate."</p>

<p>Here Samuel Hill purposely dropped his fork upon the
floor and was obliged to get under the table to recover it,
Betsy assisting him in the search. When they emerged
from under the table their faces were red with their exertions.</p>

<p>As we have seen on other occasions, the Professor was
very quick in rescuing himself from any dilemma into
which he might be thrown. He saw an opportunity to
divert attention from himself and speedily improved it.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have to walk over and see Miss Tilly James
this afternoon," said the Professor.</p>

<p>At this shot at Samuel Hill and Betsy everybody
laughed, including Quincy, and thus the ice was broken.</p>

<p>"I've heard some pretty big lies told in my life," said
Robert Wood, "but I think Abel Coffin, yer know him,
Professor, old Jonathan Coffin's son, the one that goes carpenterin',
he lives over in Montrose, yer know, can beat
anybody we've got in this town, not exceptin' you, Stiles;"
and he gave the latter a nudge with his elbow that nearly
knocked him out of his chair.</p>

<p>"Tell us the story, Robert," said the Professor, who had
recovered his self-complacency; "we're dyin' to hear it."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Robert Wood, "Abel had been shinglin'
a house, and I told him there wuz a place where he'd
left off a shingle. Abel laughed and, sez he, 'If I hadn't
better eyesight than you've got I'd carry a telescope 'round
with me.' 'Well,' sez I, thinkin' I'd fool him, 'let's see
which one of us has got the best eyesight.' I pointed up
to the ridgepole of the house, which was 'bout a hundred
feet off from where we stood, and sez I to Abel, 'Can you
see that fly walkin' along on the ridgepole near the chimney?
I ken.' Abel put his hand up back of his ear, and
<a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"></a>sez he, 'No, I can't see him, but I can hear him walkin'
'round.'"</p>

<p>As Robert concluded, a loud shout of laughter went up
from the table. Quincy had no desire to be considered
"stuck up," so he joined in the laugh, although he had
heard the story in a different form before.</p>

<p>So had the Professor, and he never allowed an old story
to be told in his presence without working in two lines of
doggerel which he had composed, and of which he was
very proud. So, turning to Robert Wood he said patronizingly,
"That was very well told, Robert. The story is
an old one, but you worked it up very nicely; but," continued
the Professor, "as I have often remarked on similar
occasions:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
It makes no difference whether a story's new or old,<br />
Everything depends on the way it's told."<br />
</p>

<p>Turning quickly to Quincy he said, "No doubt Mr. Sawyer
can favor us with a story that we've never heard before."</p>

<p>Quincy was a little taken aback, for the appeal was unexpected,
but he quickly recovered his self-possession and
said in a low but pleasant voice, "I am afraid that my story
will have to depend on the way it is told rather than upon
its novelty." He wondered if his hearers were acquainted
with the travels of Baron Munchausen, but decided to try
the experiment. "About a year ago," resumed Quincy,
"I went down to Maine on some law business. I transacted
it, but had to travel some ten miles to the county town to
record my papers. I had a four-wheeled buggy, and a
strong, heavily-built horse. It began to snow very fast
after I started, but I knew the road and drove steadily on.
As I approached the county town I noticed that the snow
was deeper than the highest building in the town, in fact,
<a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a>none of the town was visible, excepting about three feet of
the spire of the tallest church in the place."</p>

<p>Quincy stopped and glanced about the table. Every eye
was fastened upon him, and all, including the Professor
and Stiles particularly, were listening intently. Quincy
continued his story:</p>

<p>"I was well supplied with buffalo robes, so after tying
my horse firmly to the weather vane on the spire, I made
up a bed on the snow with my buffalo robes, and slept
soundly and comfortably all night. When I woke in the
morning I was still enveloped in the robes, but found to my
surprise that I was lying upon the ground. I looked
around, but there was no sign of snow anywhere. I arose
and looked about for my horse and buggy, but they were
not in sight. Then I remembered that I had tied my horse
to the weather vane. Casting my eyes upward I saw my
horse and buggy hanging by the strap, the horse having
secured a footing on the side of the spire. Happily I had
a revolver with me, and with one shot I severed the broad
leathern strap. Naturally the horse and buggy fell to the
ground. I put my buffalo robes back into the buggy, rode
to the court house, had my papers recorded, and then
drove back ten miles to town, none the worse for my adventure,
but the stableman charged me fifty cents for the
strap that I was obliged to leave on the church spire."</p>

<p>A number of low whistles, intermixed with several
"whews!" were heard, as Quincy finished his story.</p>

<p>"Wall, by thunder!" ejaculated Stiles, "how do yer account
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think it must have been a sudden thaw," remarked
Quincy, with a grave face.</p>

<p>"One thing puzzles me," said the Professor.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Quincy politely, "perhaps I can
explain."</p>

<p>"Before you left the church," asked the Professor, "why
didn't you reach up and ontie that strap?"</p><p><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a></p>

<p>Another loud shout of laughter broke from the company,
and Quincy, realizing that the Professor had beaten him
fairly by putting a point on his own story, joined heartily in
the laugh at his own expense.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said Abner Stiles, "of an adventure
that I had several years ago, down in Maine, when I wuz
younger and spryer'n I am now."</p>

<p>"How old be you?" said the Professor.</p>

<p>"Wall," replied Abner, "the family Bible makes me out
to be fifty-eight, but jedgin' from the fun I've had I'm
as old as Methooserlar."</p>

<p>This remark gave Stiles the preliminary laugh, which
he always counted upon when he told a story.</p>

<p>"Did yer ever meet a b'ar?" asked he, directing his remark
to Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, "I've stood up before one many a
time."</p>

<p>"Well, really," exclaimed Abner, "how'd yer come off?"</p>

<p>"Usually with considerable less money than when I went
up," replied Quincy, seeing that Abner was mystified.</p>

<p>"What?" said Abner. "I mean a real black b'ar, one of
those big, shaggy fellers sech as you meet in the woods
down in Maine."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Quincy, "I was talking about an open bar,
such as you find in bar-rooms and hotels."</p>

<p>This time the laugh was on Abner, and he was considerably
nettled by it.</p>

<p>"Go on, Abner, go on!" came from several voices, and
thus reassured, he continued:</p>

<p>"Wall, as I wuz goin' to say, I was out partridge shooting
down in Maine several years ago, and all I had with me
was a fowlin' piece and a pouch of bird shot. In fact, I
didn't have any shot left, for I'd killed 'bout forty partridges.
I had a piece of strong twine with me, so I tied
their legs together and slung 'em over my shoulder. I
<a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"></a>was jest goin' to start for hum when I heerd the boughs
crackin' behind me, and turnin' 'round I saw&mdash;Geewhillikins!&mdash;a
big black b'ar not more'n ten feet from me. I
had nothin' to shoot him with, and knew that the only way
to save my life wuz to run for it. I jest bent over and
threw the partridges on the ground, thinkin' as I did so
that perhaps the b'ar would stop to eat them, and I could
git away. I started to run, but caught my toe in some
underbrush and went down ker-slap. I said all the prayers
I knew in 'bout eight seconds, then got up, and started to
run ag'in. Like Lot's wife, I couldn't help lookin' back,
and there wuz the b'ar flat on his back. I went up to him
kinder cautious, for I didn't know but he might be shammin',
them black b'ars are mighty cute; but, no, he wuz
deader'n a door nail. I took the partridges back to town,
and then a party on us came back and toted the b'ar home."</p>

<p>Every one sat quietly for a moment, then Quincy asked
with a sober face, "What caused the bear's death; was it
heart disease?"</p>

<p>"No," said Abner, "'twas some sort of brain trouble.
Yer see, when I threw those partridges onter the ground it
brought a purty powerful strain onto my galluses. When
we cut the b'ar up we found one of my pants buttons right
in the centre of his brain."</p>

<p>Abner's story was greeted with those signs of approval
that were so dear to his heart, and Quincy, realizing that
when you are in Rome you must do as the Romans do, was
not backward in his applause.</p>

<p>All eyes were now turned to the Professor.</p>

<p>"I don't think," said he, "that I can make up a lie to
match with those that have jist been told, but if any of you
are enough interested in the truth to want to listen to a
true story, I kin tell you one that came under my observation
a few days ago."</p>

<p>All looked inquiringly at Strout, but none spoke.</p><p><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a></p>

<p>"Wall," said he, "I s'pose I must consider as how silence
means consent, and go ahead. Wall" he continued, "you
all know, or most all on yer do, old Bill Tompkins, that
lives out on the road to Montrose. This occurrence took
place early las' summer. Old Bill hisself is too close-mouthed
to let on about it, but when I was over there the
other day, arter givin' Lizzy Tompkins her music-lesson, I
got talkin' with her mother, and one thing led to another,
and finally I got the whole story outer her. Old Bill had
a cow that they called 'Old Jinnie.' She was always mischeevous,
but last year she'd been wusser'n ever. She'd
git out of the barn nights, and knock down fences, and
tramp down flower gardens, and everybody said she wuz a
pesky noosance. One night old Bill and his family wuz
seated 'round the centre table in the sittin'-room. There
wuz Mary, his wife; and George, his oldest boy, a young
fellow about eighteen; Tommy, who is a ten-year-older,
and little Lizzy, who is about eight. George wuz readin'
somethin' out of a paper to 'em, when they heerd a-runnin'
and a-jumpin', and old Bill said, 'That varmint's got out of
the barn and is rampagin' 'round agin,' The winder
curt'ins wuz up, and old Jinnie must 'a' seed the light, for
she run pell-mell agin the house, and drove her horns
through the winder, smashin' four panes. Old Bill and
George managed to git her back inter the barn and tied her
up.</p>

<p>"As they wuz walking back to the house, old Bill said,
'Consarn her picter, I'll make beef o' her to-morrer or my
name ain't Bill Tompkins,' When they got back to the
settin'-room, George said, 'How be yer goin' ter do it, dad?'
'Why, cut her throat,' said Bill. 'You can't do it,' said
George, 'the law sez yer must shoot her fust in the temple,'
'All right,' said old Bill, 'you shoot and I'll carve,' So next
mornin' they led old Jinnie out with her head p'inted
towards the barn. George had loaded up the old musket,
<a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a>and stood 'bout thirty feet off. George didn't know just
edzactly where the cow's temple wuz, but he imagined it
must be somewhere atween her eyes, so he fired and hit
her squar' in the forehead. That was enough for old Jinnie,
she jist ducked her head, and with a roar like the bull of
Bashan she put for George. He dropped the musket and
went up the ladder inter the haymow livelier'n he ever did
before, you kin bet. Old Jinnie struck the ladder and
knocked it galley-west. Old Jinnie then turned 'round and
spied little Tommy. He put, and she put arter him. There
wasn't nothin' else to do, so Tommy took a high jump and
landed in the pig-sty. Old Bill is kinder deef in one ear, and
he didn't notice much what wuz goin' on on that side of
him. He was runnin' the grindstone and puttin' a good
sharp edge on his butcher knife, when he happened to look
up and seed old Jinnie comin' head on. He dropped the
knife and started for the house, thinkin' he'd dodge in the
front door. Over went the grindstone and old Jinnie, too,
but she wuz up on her feet ag'in quicker'n scat. She
seemed to scent the old man, for when she got to the front
door she turned in and then bolted right into the parlor.
Old Bill heerd her comin', and he went head fust through
the open winder, and landed in the orchard. He got up
and run for a big apple-tree that stood out near the road,
and never stopped till he'd clumb nearly to the top. Little
Lizzie gave a yell like a catamount and ran behind the
pianner, which was sot out a little from the wall. Old Jinnie
went bunt inter the planner and made a sandwich of
Lizzie, who wuz behind it. Mis' Tompkins heard Lizzie
scream, and come to see what the matter was. When she
see Jinnie she jist made strides for the wood-shed, and old
Jinnie sashayed arter her. Mis' Tompkins went skitin'
through the wood-shed. There wuz a pair of steps that led
up inter the corn barn, and Mis' Tompkins got up there
jist as old Jinnie walked off with the steps. Then old Jinnie
<a name="Page_347" id="Page_347"></a>took a walk outside and looked 'round as unconsarned as
though nothin' had happened. Jist about this time one
of them tin peddlers come along that druv one of them red
carts with pots, and pans, and kittles, and brooms, and
brushes, and mops hung all over it. He spied old Bill up
in the tree, and sez he, 'What be yar doin', Farmer Tompkins?'
'Pickin' apples,' said old Bill. He don't waste
words on nobody. 'Ain't it rather early for apples?' inquired
the peddler. 'These are some I forgot to pick last
fall,' replied old Bill. 'Anythin' in my line?' said the peddler.
'Ain't got no money,' said Bill. 'Hain't you got
something you want to trade?' asked the peddler. 'Yes,'
said Bill, 'I'll swap that cow over yonder; you kin have her
for fifteen dollars, an' I'll take it all in trade,' 'Good
milker?' said the man. 'Fust-class butter,' said old Bill.
'What do you want in trade?' said the man. 'Suit yerself,'
said Bill, 'chuck it down side of the road there.' This was
soon done, and the peddler druv up front of old Jinnie and
went to git her, so as to tie her behind his waggin. She
didn't stop to be led. Down went her head agin and she
made for the peddler. He got the other side of his team
jist as old Jinnie druv her horns 'tween the spokes of the
forrard wheel. Down come the pots, and pans, and kittles,
in ev'ry direction. A clotheshorse fell on the horse's back
and off he started on a dead run, and that wuz the end of
poor Jinnie. Before she could pull back her horns, round
went the wheel and broke her neck. The peddler pulled up
his horse and went back to see old Bill, who was climbin'
down from the apple tree. 'What am I goin' to do about
this?' said the peddler. 'I wuz countin' on drivin' her over
to the next town and sellin' her or tradin' her off, but I
hain't got no use for fresh beef.' 'Wall,' said old Bill, 'considering
circumstances we'll call the trade off. You kin keep
your stuff and I'll keep my beef.' The peddler loaded up
and druv off. Then old Bill went in and pulled Lizzie out
<a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a>from behind the pianner, and put up the steps so Mrs.
Tompkins could come down from the corn barn, and fished
Tommy out of the pig-sty, and threw a bucket of water
over him, and put up the ladder so George could git down
from the haymow, and they all got round poor old Jinnie
and stood as hard as they could and laughed." Here Professor
Strout pushed back his chair and rose to his feet.
"That's how old Bill Tompkins got his beef."</p>

<p>There was a general laugh and a pushing back of chairs,
and the whole company arose and went in various directions
to their afternoon work. Professor Strout went into
the front entry, for he always entered and left the house by
the front door. Quincy followed him, and closing the door
that led into the dining-room, said, "Mr. Strout, I would
like to see you in my room for half an hour on important
business."</p>

<p>"I guess 'tain't as important as some business of my own
I've got to attend to this arternoon. I'm goin' over to the
Centre to fix up my accounts as tax collector with the town
treasurer."</p>

<p>"I think my business is fully as important as that," said
Quincy, "it relates to your appointment as postmaster."</p>

<p>"Oh, you've got a hand in that, have yer?" asked Strout,
an angry flush suffusing his face.</p>

<p>"I have both hands in it," replied Quincy imperturbably,
"and it rests with you entirely whether I keep hold or let
go."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Strout, looking at his watch, "I kin spare
you half an hour, if it will be as great an accommodation
to yer as yer seem to think it will."</p>

<p>And he followed Quincy upstairs to the latter's room.</p><p><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<h3>A SETTLEMENT.<br /></h3>

<p>When they entered the room Quincy motioned
Strout to a chair, which he took. He then closed
the door and, taking a cigar case from his pocket, offered a
cigar to Strout, which the latter refused. Quincy then
lighted a cigar and, throwing himself into an armchair in a
comfortable position, looked straight at the Professor, who
returned his gaze defiantly, and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Strout, there is an open account of some two
month's standing between us, and I have asked you to
come up here to-day, because I think it is time for a settlement"</p>

<p>"I don't owe you nuthin'," said Strout, doggedly.</p>

<p>"I think you owe me better treatment than you have
given me the past two months," remarked Quincy, "but
we'll settle that point later."</p>

<p>"I guess I've treated you as well as you have me," retorted
Strout, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"But you began it," said Quincy, "and had it all your
own way for two months; I waited patiently for you to
stop, but you wouldn't, so the last week I've been squaring
up matters, and there is only one point that hasn't been
settled. From what I have heard," continued Quincy, "I
am satisfied that Miss Mason has received full reparation
for any slanderous remarks that may have been started or
circulated by you concerning herself."</p>

<p>The Professor attentively regarded the pattern of the
carpet on the floor.</p>

<p>Quincy continued, "Miss Lindy Putnam has repeated to
<a name="Page_350" id="Page_350"></a>me what she told Mr. Stiles about her visit to Boston, and
attributed the distorted and untrue form in which it reached
the inhabitants of this town to your well-known powers of
invention. Am I right?"</p>

<p>The Professor looked up. "I'll have somethin' to say
when you git through," he replied.</p>

<p>"I expect and ask no apology or reparation for what
you've said about me," remarked Quincy. "You made your
boast that one of us had got to leave town, and it wouldn't
be you. When I heard that I determined to stay at whatever
cost, and we'll settle this afternoon which one of us is
going to change his residence."</p>

<p>"I don't think you kin run me out o' town," said Strout,
savagely.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," rejoined Quincy. "Let us see
what I have done in a week. You insulted Mr. Pettengill
and his sister by not inviting them to the surprise party. I
know it was done to insult me rather than them, but you
will remember that we three were present, and had a very
pleasant time. I was the lawyer that advised Deacon Mason
not to loan that five hundred dollars to pay down on the
store. I told the Deacon I would loan him five hundred
dollars if the store was knocked down to you, but I would
have had that store if it had cost me ten thousand dollars
instead of three. I was the one who put your war record
in the hands of Mr. Tobias Smith, and I was the one that
prepared the statement which showed how negligent you
had been in attending to your duties as tax collector."</p>

<p>"Payin' so much attention to other people's business
must have made yer forget yer own," said Strout, shutting
his teeth together with a snap.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," remarked Quincy, with a laugh; "I had plenty
of time left to take a hand in village politics, and my friend
Mr. Stackpole was elected by a very handsome vote, as you
<a name="Page_351" id="Page_351"></a>have no doubt heard." Strout dug his heel into the carpet,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Quincy, "I've had your appointment
as postmaster held up till you and I come to terms."</p>

<p>"You're takin' a lot of trouble for nothin'," said Strout.
"I can't be postmaster unless I have a store. I guess I kin
manage to live with my music teachin' and organ playin'
at the church."</p>

<p>"I've thought of that," said Quincy. "I don't wish to go
to extremes, but I will if it is necessary. Before you leave
this room, Mr. Strout, you must decide whether you will
work with me or against me in the future."</p>

<p>"S'posin' I decide to work agin yer?" asked Strout;
"what then?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy sternly, "if you drive me to it, I'll
bring down a couple of good music teachers from Boston.
They'll teach music for nothing, and I'll pay them good
salaries. The church needs a new organ, and I'll make
them a present of one, on condition that they get a new
organist."</p>

<p>Strout looked down reflectively for a few minutes, then
he glanced up and a queer smile passed over his face.
"S'posin' I switch 'round," said he, "and say I'll work with
yer?"</p>

<p>"If you say it and mean it, Mr. Strout," replied Quincy,
rising from his chair, "I'll cross off the old score and start
fresh from to-day. I'm no Indian, and have no vindictive
feelings. You and I have been playing against each other
and you've lost every trick. Now, if you say so, we'll play
as partners. I'll give you a third interest in the grocery
store for a thousand dollars. The firm name shall be Strout
&amp; Maxwell. I'll put in another thousand dollars to buy a
couple of horses and wagons, and we'll take orders and deliver
goods free to any family within five miles of the store.
Maxwell will have a third, and I'll have a third as silent
<a name="Page_352" id="Page_352"></a>partner, and I'll see that you get your appointment as
postmaster."</p>

<p>Quincy looked at Strout expectantly, awaiting his answer.
Finally it came.</p>

<p>"Considerin' as how you put it," said Strout, "I don't
think you and me will clash in the futur'."</p>

<p>Quincy extended his hand, which Strout took, and the
men shook hands.</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Just half an hour!" exclaimed Strout, looking at his
watch.</p>

<p>A loud knock was heard on the door.</p>

<p>"I guess Abner has got tired o' waitin' and has come
arter me," remarked Strout.</p>

<p>Quincy opened the door and Mr. Stiles stood revealed.</p>

<p>"Is Professor Strout here?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy; "come in."</p>

<p>"I guess I'll see him out here," continued Abner. "What
I've got to say may be kinder private."</p>

<p>"Come in, Abner," cried Strout, "and let's hear what's
on your mind."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Abner, looking askance at Quincy, "if yer
satisfied, I am. Hiram Maxwell's jest came down from
Mis' Putnam's, and Mis' Heppy Putnam's dead,"&mdash;Quincy
started on hearing this,&mdash;"and Samanthy Green is
at her wits' end, 'cause she never was alone in the house
with a dead pusson afore, an' Hiram's goin' to take Betsy
Green back to stay with her sister, and then he's goin' to
take Miss Alice Pettengill down home, cuz Miss Pettengill's
most tired out; cuz, you see, she's been there since
eight o'clock this mornin', and Mis' Putnam didn't die till
about one o'clock, and Samanthy says Mis' Putnam took
on awful, so you could hear her all over the house, and
Miss Lindy Putnam, she's goin' to take the next train to
Bosting&mdash;she's goin', bag and baggage&mdash;and I've got to
<a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"></a>drive her over to the station, and Bob Wood, he's comin'
along with a waggin to carry her trunks and bandboxes
and sich, and so I've come to tell yer, Professor, that I
can't take yer over to the Centre this arternoon, no how."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Abner," said Strout; "considerin' as
how things has gone, to-morrow will do just as well, but I
wish you'd drop in and tell the town treasurer that I'm
goin' into business with Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Sawyer
here,"&mdash;Abner's eyes dilated,&mdash;"under the firm name of
Strout, Maxwell, &amp; Co."</p>

<p>"No!" interrupted Quincy, "let the sign read, Strout &amp;
Maxwell."</p>

<p>"And," continued Mr. Strout, "Mr. Sawyer here is goin'
to push through my app'intment as postmaster."</p>

<p>By this time Abner's mouth was wide open. Quincy saw
it, and imagined the conflict going on in poor Abner's
mind.</p>

<p>"What Mr. Strout says is correct," remarked Quincy,
"but you have no time to lose now. Perhaps to-night Mr.
Strout will explain the matter more fully to you."</p>

<p>Abner turned, without a word, and left the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Stiles is a faithful friend of yours," said Quincy,
turning to the Professor.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Strout; "Abner's a very good shaft
horse, but he wouldn't be of much vally as a lead."</p>

<p>Quincy again extended his cigar case. This time the
Professor did not refuse, but took two. Holding up one
of them between his fingers, he said, "This is the one I
didn't take when I came in."</p>

<p>"I will have the partnership papers drawn up in a few
days, Mr. Strout, ready for signature, and I will write at
once to my friends in Washington, and urge them to see
the Postmaster General, and have your appointment made
as soon as possible."</p><p><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a></p>

<p>"Yer don't let no grass grow under yer feet, do yer?"
said Strout.</p>

<p>Quincy was a little taken aback by this remark, for he
had not anticipated a compliment from the Professor. He
turned to him and said, "Until you forfeit my esteem, we
are friends, and it is always a pleasure to me to help my
friends."</p>

<p>The men shook hands again, and the Professor left the
room.</p>

<p>"Not a bad man at heart," soliloquized Quincy. "I am
glad the affair has had such a pleasant termination. Poor
Alice! What a time she must have had with Mrs. Putnam,
and so Lindy is going to keep her word, and not stay to
the funeral. Well, knowing what I do, I don't blame her.
Perhaps Mrs. Putnam told Alice that Lindy was not her
own child, for Alice would not accept the fortune, I know,
if she thought she was wronging Lindy by doing so. I'll
go home,"&mdash;he smiled as he said this,&mdash;"and probably Alice
will tell me all about it."</p>

<p>He went down stairs, and not seeing Mrs. Hawkins in
the dining-room, walked out into the kitchen, where she
was hard at work washing the dinner dishes.</p>

<p>"Law, Mr. Sawyer, why didn't you holler for me ef you
wanted anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish for anything particularly," said Quincy,
"but I do wish to compliment you on your chicken salad; it
was as fine as any I ever ate at Young's, or Parker's, in
Boston, and," continued he, "here are twelve dollars." He
held out the money to her, she wiped her hands on her
apron.</p>

<p>"What's that fur?" she asked. "I've got six dollars of
your money now."</p>

<p>"That's for Mandy," said Quincy; "and this," pressing
the money into her hand, "is for four weeks' room rent; I
am liable to come here any time during the next month. I
<a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a>am going into business with Mr. Strout and Mr. Maxwell&mdash;we're
going to run the grocery store over here, and it
will be very handy to be so near to the store until we get
the business established. Good afternoon, Mrs. Hawkins,"
and he took her hand, which was still wet, in his, and shook
it warmly.</p>

<p>He turned to leave the house by the kitchen door, but
Mrs. Hawkins interposed.</p>

<p>"You better go out the front way," said she, and she ran
before him and opened the door leading to the front entry,
and then the front door. As he passed out, she said, "I
wish you success, Mr. Sawyer, and we'll gin you all our
trade."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Quincy. He walked down the path,
opened the front gate, and as he closed it raised his hat to
Mrs. Hawkins, who stood in the front doorway, her thin,
angular face wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>"Wall," said she, as she closed the front door and walked
back into the kitchen, "what lies some folks tell. Now, that
Professor Strout has allus said that Mr. Sawyer was so
stuck up that he wouldn't speak to common folks. Wall, I
think he's a real gentleman. 'Twon't do for any one to run
him down to me after this."</p>

<p>Here she thought of her money, and, spreading out the
three bills in her hand, she opened the kitchen door and
screamed at the top of her voice, "Jonas! Jonas!! Jonas!!!"
There were no signs of Jonas. "Where is that man? He's
never 'round when he's wanted."</p>

<p>"What is it, Marthy?" said a voice behind her. Turning,
she saw her husband puffing away at his brierwood pipe.</p>

<p>"I thought you went out to the barn," said she, "to help
Abner hitch up?"</p>

<p>"Wall, I did," he replied; "but it didn't take two on us
long to do that. I eat so much chicken salad that it laid
kinder heavy on my stummick, so I went out in the wood-shed
<a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a>to have a smoke. But where did you git all that
money?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer took the front room for two weeks and
paid for it ahead, and do you know he said my chicken
salad was jist as good as Mrs. Young and Mrs. Parker
makes down to Bosting."</p>

<p>"I don't know Mrs. Young nor Mrs. Parker," said Jonas,
"but on makin' chicken salad I'll match Mrs. Hawkins
agin 'em any day;" and he went out in the wood-shed to
finish his smoke.</p>

<p>As Quincy walked down the road towards the Pettengill
house his mind was busy with his thoughts.</p>

<p>"To think," said he to himself, "that while I was listening
to those stories, to call them by no worse name, at the
dinner table, the woman I love was witnessing the death
agony and listening to the last words of a dear friend&mdash;the
woman who's going to leave her a fortune. Now that she
knows that she's an heiress, I can speak; she never would
have listened to me, knowing that she was poor and I was
rich, and I never could have spoken to her with that secret
in my mind that Mrs. Putnam told me&mdash;that she was going
to leave her all her money. I am so glad for Alice's sake,
even if she does not love me. She can have the best medical
attendance now, and she will be able to give all her
time to her literary work, for which she has a decided
genius. Won't she be delighted when I tell her that Leopold
has placed all her stories and wants her to write a
book?"</p>

<p>As he reached the front gate he saw Hiram driving up
the road and Alice was with him. As Hiram stopped,
Quincy stepped forward and took Alice's hand to assist her
in alighting from the buggy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Sawyer," said she, "have you heard that Mrs.
Putnam is dead, and I've had such a terrible day with her?"</p>

<p>Her nervous system had been wrought to its highest
<a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"></a>tension by what she had undergone during the past six
hours. She burst into a flood of tears. Then she tottered
and would have fallen if Quincy had not grasped her.</p>

<p>"Can you walk?" he asked.</p>

<p>She took a step forward, but he saw at a glance that she
had not sufficient strength to reach her room.</p>

<p>"Open the gate, Hiram. Then give the door-bell a good
sharp ring, so that Mandy will come quickly."</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and went up the path, by the
astonished Mandy, and upstairs to Alice's room, where he
laid her tenderly upon her bed. Turning to Mandy, who
had followed close at his heels, he said:</p>

<p>"She is not sick, only nervous and worn out. If you
need me, call me."</p>

<p>He went into his own room and thanked Heaven that
he had been at hand to render her the service that she so
much needed. When he went down to supper Mandy told
him that Miss Alice was asleep, and she guessed she'd be
all right in the morning.</p><p><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358"></a></p>

<h3>AN INHERITANCE.<br /></h3>

<p>Quincy reached his room at Mrs. Hawkins's boarding
house about midnight of the day of the town
meeting. About the same hour Mrs. Heppy Putnam
awoke from a troubled sleep and felt a pain, like the thrust
of a knife blade, through her left side. The room was
dark and cold, the wood fire in the open grate having died
out a couple of hours before, while a cool wind was blowing
with great force outside.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam came of the old stock which considered it
a virtue to suffer and be silent, rather than call out and be
saved. So she lay for five long hours suffering intense
pain, but declaring to herself, with all the sturdiness of an
old Roman warrior or an Indian chief, that she would not
ask for any assistance "till it wuz time for folks to git up."</p>

<p>This delay was fatal, or was destined to become so, but
she did not know it; she had had colds before, and she had
always got well. Why should'nt she now? It is a strange
vagary of old people to consider themselves just as young
as they used to be, notwithstanding their advanced years.
To the majority of the old people, the idea of death is not
so appalling as the inability to work and the incapacity to
enjoy the customary pleasures of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam had always been an active, energetic
woman until she had lost her power to walk as the result of
rheumatic fever; in fact, it was always acknowledged and
said by the country folk that she was the better half of the
matrimonial firm of Silas and Hepsibeth Putnam. Since
her husband's failure to mount to Heaven on the day fixed
<a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a>for the Second Advent she had had entire control of the
family finances. Her investments, many of which had
been suggested by her deceased son, J. Jones Putnam, had
been very profitable.</p>

<p>She owned the house in which she lived, which was the
largest, best finished, and best furnished one in the town of
Eastborough. It occupied a commanding position on the
top of a hill, and from its upper windows could be obtained
a fine view of the surrounding country. The soil at Mason's
Corner was particularly fertile, and this fact had led to the
rapid growth of the village, which was three miles from the
business centre of Eastborough, and only a mile from the
similar part of the adjoining town of Montrose.</p>

<p>Back of the Putnam homestead were the best barns, carriage
houses, sheds and other outbuildings to be found in
the town, but for years they had been destitute of horses,
cattle, and other domestic animals.</p>

<p>Mr. Putnam had disliked dogs because they killed sheep,
and Mrs. Putnam detested cats. For years no chanticleer
had awakened echoes during the morning hours, and no
hens or chickens wandered over the neglected farm. The
trees in the large orchard had not been pruned for a long
time, and the large vegetable garden was overrun with
grass and weeds.</p>

<p>Back of the orchard and the vegetable garden, and to
the right and left of the homestead, were about a hundred
and sixty acres of arable pasture and wood-land, the whole
forming what could be easily made the finest farm in the
town.</p>

<p>The farm had been neglected simply because the income
from her investments was more than sufficient for the support
of the family. The unexpended income had been
added to the principal, until Mrs. Putnam's private fortune
now amounted to fully fifty thousand dollars, invested
<a name="Page_360" id="Page_360"></a>in good securities, together with the house and farm,
which were free from mortgage.</p>

<p>When the first streaks of morning reached the room
in which Mrs. Putnam lay upon her bed of pain, she seized
one of her crutches, and pounded vigorously upon the
floor. In a short time Samanthy Green entered the room.
She was buttoning up her dress as she came in, and her
hair was in a dishevelled condition.</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth's the matter? You wheeze like
our old pump out in the barn. You do look real sick, to
be sure."</p>

<p>"Wall, if you don't like the looks of me," said Mrs. Putnam
sharply, "don't look at me."</p>

<p>"But didn't you pound?" asked Samanthy. "Don't you
want me to go for the doctor?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Putnam, "I don't want no doctor.
The fust thing that I want you to do is to go and comb
that frowzy pate of yourn, and when you git that done I
want yer to make me a mustard plaster 'bout as big as
that;" and she held up her hands about a foot apart.
"Now go, and don't stand and look at me as though I wuz
a circus waggin."</p>

<p>Samanthy left the room quickly, but she had no sooner
closed the door when Mrs. Putnam called out her name
in a loud voice, and Samanthy opened the door and looked
in.</p>

<p>"Did you call, marm?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course I did," said Mrs. Putnam testily. "I guess
ye wouldn't have come back if yer hadn't known I did."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam was evidently in a bad temper, and Samanthy
had learned by years of experience to keep a close
mouth under such circumstances, so she waited for Mrs.
Putnam's next words without replying. Finally Mrs Putnam
spoke. "I wish you'd bring up some wood and start
a fire, the room's kinder cold."</p><p><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a></p>

<p>When Samanthy reached the kitchen she found Lindy
there.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Lindy," said she, "what are you up so early
for?"</p>

<p>"I heard mother pounding and I thought she might be
sick."</p>

<p>"She is awful sick," rejoined Samanthy; "I never saw
her look so poorly afore; she seems to be all choked up.
She wants a big mustard plaster and a fire up in her room,
and I don't know which to do fust. Oh!" she cried, "I
must comb my hair before I go back;" and she wet a brush
and commenced brushing out her long brown hair, which,
with her rosy cheeks, formed her two principal claims to
good looks.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Lindy, "and I'll fix your hair up much
quicker than you can do it yourself."</p>

<p>"And much better, too," added Samanthy thankfully.</p>

<p>"While you're building the fire," continued Lindy, "I'll
mix up the mustard plaster."</p>

<p>When Samanthy entered the chamber with the materials
for the fire, Mrs. Putnam opened her eyes and said sharply,
"Did yer bring that plaster?"</p>

<p>"No," said Samanthy, "I thought I would build the fire
fust."</p>

<p>"Wall," said Mrs. Putnam, "I want the plaster fust, and
you go right down stairs and mix it up quick."</p>

<p>When Samanthy returned to the kitchen she found that
Lindy had the plaster all ready. Samanthy took it, and
started upstairs.</p>

<p>Lindy said to her, "Don't tell her that I made it." As
she said this she stepped back into the kitchen and closed
the door.</p>

<p>As Samanthy approached the bedside with the plaster,
Mrs. Putnam looked up and asked, "Did you make that
plaster, Samanthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Samanthy.</p><p><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a></p>

<p>"You're lyin', Samanthy Green, and you know yer are.
You can't fool me. Didn't I hear yer talkin' to somebody
in the kitchen?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," assented Samanthy.</p>

<p>"Wall," rejoined Mrs. Putnam, "of course I know who
it wuz yer wuz talkin' to. Did she make the plaster?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," again assented Samanthy.</p>

<p>"Give it to me," said Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>Samanthy passed it to her, and the old lady crumpled
it in her hand's and threw it across the room. "Now go
down stairs, Samanthy Green, and make me a mustard
plaster, as I told yer to, and when I git up outer this I'll
see if I can't git somebody to wait on me that kin tell the
truth 'thout my havin' to help 'em."</p>

<p>In the course of half an hour the new plaster was made
and applied, and a bright fire was shedding its warmth
into the room.</p>

<p>"Go down stairs and git yer breakfast," said Mrs. Putnam.
"'Tis a trifle early, but I hearn tell that lyin' makes
people hungry."</p>

<p>As Samanthy gave her an inquiring look, Mrs. Putnam
said, "No, I don't want nothin' to eat or drink nuther, but
when yer git the dishes washed I want yer ter go on an
errand for me."</p>

<p>It was half past six when Samanthy Green again stood
in Mrs. Putnam's room.</p>

<p>"I want yer to go right down to Zeke Pettengill's and
tell his sister Alice that I want her to come right up here.
Tell her it's my las' sickness, and I won't take 'no' for an
answer. Be sure you put it to her jest as I do; and Samanthy,"
as Samanthy opened the door and was leaving
the room, "say, Samanthy, don't git anybody to do the
errand for you."</p>

<p>About ten minutes after Samanthy left the house, Lindy
Putnam entered the sick room. Mrs. Putnam's pain had
<a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a>been relieved somewhat by the mustard, and this relief restored,
to a great extent, her usual vigor of mind.</p>

<p>"What are you up here for?" cried Mrs. Putnam, a look
of displeasure clouding her face.</p>

<p>"I knew Samanthy had gone out, and so I came up to
see if I could do anything for you, mother."</p>

<p>"Don't mother me. I ain't your mother, and I mean
everybody shall know it soon's I'm dead."</p>

<p>"I've had to say mother before other people," explained
Lindy, "and that's why I forgot myself then. Pray excuse
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't put on yer citified airs when yer talkin' to me.
Ain't yer glad I'm goin' ter die?"</p>

<p>"I hope you will get better, Mrs. Putnam," answered
Lindy.</p>

<p>"You know better," rejoined Mrs. Putnam. "You'll be
glad when I'm gone, for then you kin go gallivantin' 'round
and spend the money that my son worked hard fur."</p>

<p>"I've used very little of it," said Lindy; "less than the
interest; I have never touched the principal."</p>

<p>Lindy still remained standing at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>"Didn't yer hear me say I didn't want nuthin'?" asked
Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"I will leave the room then," replied Lindy quietly.</p>

<p>"I wish you would," said Mrs. Putnam, "and you'll do
me a favor if you'll pack yer duds as quick as yer can
and git out of the house and never come back agin."</p>

<p>"I will leave the room, but I cannot leave the house
while you are alive," remarked Lindy firmly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Mrs. Putnam. "I want to die in peace,
and I shall go much easier if I know I haven't got to set
my eyes on your face agin."</p>

<p>"I promised Jones," said Lindy, "that I would never
leave you while you were alive."</p>

<p>"Oh, you promised Jones, did yer?" cried Mrs. Putnam
<a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"></a>with a sneer. "Wall, Jones will let you off on yer promise
jest to 'blige me, so yer needn't stay any longer."</p>

<p>As Lindy walked towards the door, Mrs. Putnam spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Did yer ever tell anybody I wasn't yer mother?" Lindy
hesitated. "Why don't you out with it," said Mrs. Putnam,
"and say no, no matter if it is a lie? Samanthy can
lie faster'n a horse can trot, and I know you put her up to
it."</p>

<p>"I have been impudent and disrespectful to you many
times, Mrs. Putnam, when you were cross to me, but I
never told you a deliberate lie in my life. I have told one
person that you were not my mother."</p>

<p>"What did yer do it fur?" asked Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"I wished to retain his good opinion," replied Lindy.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" inquired Mrs. Putnam eagerly. Lindy
did not answer. "Oh, you won't tell!" said Mrs. Putnam.
"Wall, I bet I can guess; it's that feller that's boardin'
over to Pettingill's."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam saw the blood rise in Lindy's face, and she
chuckled to herself.</p>

<p>"What reason have you for forming such an opinion?"
asked Lindy.</p>

<p>"Wall, I can kinder put two and two together," said
Mrs. Putnam. "The day Alice Pettengill came over here
with him you two wuz down in the parlor together, and I
had to pound on the floor three times afore I could make
him hear. I knew you must be either spoonin' or abusin'
me."</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Lindy kept back the words
which rose to her lips, but she said nothing.</p>

<p>"Did yer tell him that I wuz goin' to leave my money
to some one else?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't necessary," said Lindy, "I judged from some
things that he said that you had told him yourself."</p><p><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365"></a></p>

<p>"Did he tell you who it wuz?" persisted Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"No," said Lindy. "I did my best to find out, but he
wouldn't tell me."</p>

<p>"Good for him," cried Mrs. Putnam. "Then ye don't
know?"</p>

<p>"I can put two and two together," replied Lindy.</p>

<p>"But where'd yer git the two and two?" asked Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"Oh, I have surmised for a long time," continued Lindy.
"This morning I asked Samanthy where she was going,
and she said down to Pettengill's. Then I knew."</p>

<p>"I told her not to tell," said Mrs. Putnam, "the lyin'
jade. If I git up off this bed she'll git her walkin' ticket."</p>

<p>"She's ready to go," said Lindy; "she told me this morning
that she'd wait until you got a new girl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam closed her eyes and placed both of her hands
over her heart. Despite her fortitude the intense
pain wrung a groan from her.</p>

<p>Lindy rushed forward and dropped on her knees beside
the bed. "Forgive me, Mrs. Putnam," said she, "but you
spoke such cruel words to me that I could not help answering
you in the same way. I am so sorry. I loved
your son with all my heart, and I had no right to speak so
to his mother, no matter what she said to me."</p>

<p>The paroxysm of pain had passed, and Mrs. Putnam was
her old self again. Looking at the girl who was kneeling
with her head bowed down she said, "I guess both of us
talked about as we felt; as for loving my son, yer had no
right to, and he had no right to love you."</p>

<p>"But we were brother and sister," cried Lindy, looking
up.</p>

<p>"'Twould have been all right if he'd let it stop there,"
replied Mrs. Putnam. "Who put it into his head that
there was no law agin a man marryin' his adopted sister?
You wuz a woman grown of eighteen, and he wuz only a
young boy of sixteen, and you made him love yer and turn
<a name="Page_366" id="Page_366"></a>agin his mother, and then we had ter send him away from
home ter keep yer apart, and then you ran after him, and
then he died, and it broke my heart. You wuz the cause
of it, but for yer he would be livin' now, a comfort to his
poor old mother. I hated yer then for what yer did.
Ev'ry time I look at yer I think of the happiness you stole
from me, an' I hate yer wusser'n ever."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mother!" sobbed Lindy.</p>

<p>"I'm not your mother," screamed Mrs. Putnam. "I s'pose
you must have had one, but you'll never know who she
wuz; she didn't care nuthin' fer yer, for she left yer in
the road, and Silas was fool enough to pick yer up and
bring yer home. What yer right name is nobody knows,
and mebbe yer ain't got none."</p>

<p>At this taunt Lindy arose to her feet and looked defiantly
at Mrs. Putnam. "You are not telling the truth,
Mrs. Putnam," said the girl; "you know who my parents
were, but you will not tell me."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Mrs. Putnam, "git mad and show
yer temper; that's better than sheddin' crocodile's tears,
as yer've been doin'; yer've been a curse to me from the
day I fust set eyes on yer. I've said I hate yer, and I do,
an' I'll never forgive yer fer what yer've done to me."</p>

<p>Lindy saw that words were useless. Perhaps Mrs. Putnam
might, recover, and if she did not provoke her too far
she might relent some day and tell her what she knew
about her parents; so she walked to the door and opened
it. Then she turned and said, "Good-by, Mrs. Putnam, I
truly hope that you will recover."</p>

<p>"Wall, I sha'n't," said Mrs. Putnam. "I'm goin' to die,
I want ter die. I want ter see Jones; I want ter talk ter
him; I want ter tell him how much I loved him&mdash;how
much I've suffered through yer. I'm goin' ter tell him
how I've hated yer and what fer, and when I git through
talkin' to him, I'll guarantee he'll be my way o' thinkin'."</p>

<p>As the old woman said this, with an almost superhuman
<a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a>effort she raised herself to a sitting posture, pointed her
finger at Lindy, and gave utterances to a wild, hysterical
laugh that almost froze the blood in the poor girl's veins.</p>

<p>Lindy slammed the door behind her, rushed to her own
room, locked the door, and threw herself face downward
upon the bed. Should she ever forget those last fearful
words, that vengeful face, that taunting finger, or that
mocking laugh?</p>

<p>Samanthy took Alice up to Mrs. Putnam's room about
eight o'clock. Alice knelt by the bedside. She could
not see the old lady's face, but she took her withered
hands in hers, and caressed them lovingly, saying, "Aunt
Heppy, I am sorry you are so sick. Have you had the
doctor?"</p>

<p>The old lady drew the young girl's head down close to
her and kissed her upon the cheek. "The docter kin do
me no good. I've sent fer yer becuz I know yer love me,
and I wanted to know that one person would be sorry
when I wuz gone."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," said Alice, "that I cannot see to help
you, but you are not going to die; you must have the doctor
at once."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Putnam, "I want to die, I want to see
my boy. I sent for you becuz I wanted to tell you that
I am goin' to leave this house and farm and all my money
to you."</p>

<p>"To me!" cried Alice, astonished. "Why, how can you
talk so, Aunt Heppy? You have a daughter, who is your
legal heir; how could you ever think of robbing your own
flesh and blood of her inheritance?"</p>

<p>"She's no flesh and blood of mine!"</p>

<p>"What!" cried Alice, "isn't Lindy your own child?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Putnam savagely. "Silas and me didn't
think we'd have any children, so we 'dopted her jest afore
we moved down from New Hampshire and settled in this
town."</p><p><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a></p>

<p>"Do you know who her parents were?" inquired Alice.</p>

<p>"Alice, what did you do with that letter I gave you the
las' time you were here?"</p>

<p>"It is locked up in my writing desk at home," answered
Alice.</p>

<p>"What did yer promise to do with it?" said Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"I promised," replied Alice, "not to let any one see it,
and to destroy it within twenty-four hours after your
death."</p>

<p>"And you will keep yer promise?" asked the old woman.</p>

<p>"My word is sacred," said Alice solemnly.</p>

<p>"Alice Pettengill," cried Mrs. Putnam, "if you break
your word to me I shall be sorry that I ever loved you; I
shall repent that I made you my heiress." And her voice
rose to a sharp, shrill tone. "I'll haunt you as long as you
live."</p>

<p>The girl shrank back from her.</p>

<p>"Don't mind a poor old woman whose hours are numbered,
but you'll keep yer promise, won't yer, Alice?" And
she grasped both Alice's hands convulsively.</p>

<p>"Aunt Heppy," said Alice, "I've given you my promise,
and I'll keep my word whatever happens. So don't worry
any more about it, Auntie."</p>

<p>For a few moments Mrs. Putnam remained quiet; then
she spoke in clear, even tones. Not a word was lost upon
Alice. "This adopted daughter of mine has been a curse
to me ever since I knew her. She was two years older
than Jones. They grew up together as brother and sister,
but she wasn't satisfied with that, she fell in love with my
son, and she made him love her. She turned him agin his
mother. She found out that there wuz no law agin a
man's marryin' his adopted sister. We had to send him
away from home, but she followed him. She wuz goin' to
elope with him, but I got wind of it, and I stopped that;
then Jones died away from home and left her all his money.
He wuz so bitter agin me that he put in his will that she
<a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"></a>was not to touch a dollar of my money, but better that than
to have her marry him. I stopped that!" and the old
woman chuckled to herself. Then her mood changed.
"Such a marriage would 'a' been a sin agin God and man,"
she said sternly. "She robbed me of my son, my only
boy, but I'll git even with her. She asked me this mornin'
if I knew who her parents wuz. I told her no, that she
was a waif picked up in a New Hampshire road, but I lied
to her. I had to."</p>

<p>"But do you know who they were?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do," said Mrs. Putnam; "that letter you've
got, and that yer promised to destroy, tells all about 'em,
but she shall never see it. Never! Never!! Never!!!"</p>

<p>Again she rose to a sitting posture, and again that wild,
mocking laugh rang through the house. Lindy, still lying
upon her bed in her room, heard it, shuddered, and covered
her ears with her hands to shut out the terrible sound.
Samanthy, in the kitchen, heard it, and saying to herself,
"Mrs. Putnam has gone crazy, and only that blind girl
with her," ran upstairs.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Putnam uttered that wild laugh, Alice started
from her chair with beating heart and a frightened look
upon her face. As the door opened and Samanthy entered,
Alice stepped forward. She could not see who it was, but
supposing it was Lindy, she cried out, "Oh, Lindy, I'm so
glad you've come!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Putnam had fallen back exhausted upon her pillow;
when she heard the name Lindy she tried to rise
again, but could not. But her indomitable spirit still survived.</p>

<p>"So you've come back, have you?" she shrieked. "Yer
couldn't let me die in peace. You want to hear more, do
you? Well, I'll tell you the truth. I know who your parents
are, but I destroyed the letter; it's burned. That's
what I had the fire built for this mornin'. You robbed me
of my son and I've got even with yer." The old woman
<a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a>pointed her finger at poor Samanthy, who stood petrified
in the doorway, and shrieked again, "Go!" and she pointed
her withered finger toward the door, "and hunt for your
parents."</p>

<p>The astonished Samanthy finally plucked up courage to
close the door; she ran to Lindy's room and pounded upon
the door until Lindy was forced to admit her; then the
frightened girl told Lindy what she had heard, and again
the worse than orphan threw herself upon her bed and
prayed that she, too, might die.</p>

<p>Alice did not swoon, but she sank upon the floor, overcome
by the horror of the scene. No sound came from
the bed. Was she dead? Alice groped her way back to
the chair in which she had previously sat; she leaned over
and listened. Mrs. Putnam was breathing still&mdash;faint,
short breaths. Alice took one of her hands in hers and
prayed for her. Then she prayed for the unhappy girl.
Then she thought of the letter and the promise she had
made. Should she keep her promises to the dying woman,
and thus be a party to the wronging of this poor girl?</p>

<p>"Mrs. Putnam! Mrs. Putnam!! Aunt Heppy!!!" she
cried; "take back your fortune, I do not want it; only release
me from my oath. Oh, that I could send for that
letter and put it back into her hands before she dies! If
Mr. Sawyer were only here; but I do not know where to
find him."</p>

<p>For hours, it seemed ages to Alice, she remained by the
bedside of the dying woman, seeing nothing, but listening
intently, and hoping that she would revive, hear her words,
and release her from that horrid oath.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Alice started; the poor old wrinkled, wasted
hand that she held in hers, was cold&mdash;so cold&mdash;she leaned
over and put her ear above the old woman's lips. There
was no sound of breathing. She pulled down the bed-clothes
and placed her hand upon her heart. It was still.<a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a>
Mrs. Putnam had gone to meet the boy she had loved and
lost.</p>

<p>Feeling her way along the wall, she reached the door.
Flinging it wide open, she cried, "Samantha! Lindy!"</p>

<p>Samanthy came to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"What is it, Miss Pettengill?" asked she.</p>

<p>"She's dead," said Alice, and she sank down upon the
stairway.</p>

<p>Samanthy ran quickly upstairs. She went first to Miss
Lindy's room and told her that all was over; then she
came back, went into Mrs. Putnam's room, pulled down
the curtains, went to the bed and laid the sheet over Mrs.
Putnam's face. She looked at the fire to see that it was
safe, came out and closed the door. Then she helped
Alice down stairs, led her into the parlor and seated her in
an easy-chair.</p>

<p>"I'll bring you a nice cup of hot tea," said she; "I've
just made some for dinner."</p>

<p>Lindy came down stairs and went to the front door.
Hiram was there, smoking a cigar, and beating his arms to
keep warm. He had been waiting outside for a couple
of hours, and he was nearly frozen.</p>

<p>"Mr. Maxwell," said Lindy; and Hiram came up the
steps. "Mrs. Putnam is dead," said she. "She expired
just a few moments ago, about one o'clock," she continued,
looking at her watch. "I want you to go right down to
Mrs. Hawkins's and bring Betsy Green back to stay with
her sister; then tell Mr. Stiles to come up at once with the
buggy and a wagon to carry my trunks to the station. Tell
Mr. Stiles I am going to Boston on the next train. When
you come back you can take Miss Pettengill home. She
will be through her lunch by the time you get back. After
you've taken her home, I want you to go and get Mrs.
Pinkham, the nurse; tell her Mrs. Putnam, is dead, and
that I want her to come and lay her out. Then drive over
to Montrose and tell Mr. Tilton, the undertaker, that I
<a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"></a>want him to make all the arrangements for the funeral
And take this for your trouble," said she, as she passed
him a five dollar bill.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too much," cried Hiram, drawing back.</p>

<p>"Take it," said Lindy, with a smile; "I have plenty more&mdash;more
than I need&mdash;more than I know what to do with."</p>

<p>As Hiram drove off he said to himself, "Lucky girl; she's
mighty putty, too. I wonder that city feller didn't shine
up to her. I s'pose she's comin' back to the funeral."</p>

<p>As Lindy turned to go upstairs she looked into the parlor,
and saw Alice sitting with her head bowed upon her
hand. Her first impulse was to go in and try to justify herself
in the eyes of this girl, with whom she knew that Mr.
Sawyer was in love; but no, she was but a waif, with no
name, no birthright, no heritage; that woman had cut her
off from her people. Truly, she had avenged her fancied
wrongs.</p>

<p>So Lindy went upstairs to her room, and remained there
until after Alice went home.</p>

<p>When Abner Stiles returned from Eastborough, after
having seen Lindy Putnam and all her belongings safe on
board the Boston train, he stopped at the Putnam house
to see if he could be of any further service. Mrs. Pinkham
had arrived some time before, and had attended to
those duties which she had performed for many years for
both the young and old of Mason's Corner, who had been
called to their long home. Mr. Tilton, the undertaker
from Montrose, had come over immediately, and had given
the necessary professional service which such sad occasions
demand. Mrs. Pinkham called to Mr. Tilton, and
he came to the door.</p>

<p>"No; there is really nothing you can do, Mr. Stiles, unless
you will be so kind as to drive around to Deacon
Mason's, Mr. Pettengill's, and Mrs. Hawkins's, and inform
them that the funeral will be from the church, at two
<a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"></a>o'clock Friday afternoon. I will see that you are paid
for your services."</p>

<p>Undertakers are naturally polite and courteous men.
They step softly, speak low, and are even-tempered. Their
patrons do not worry them with questions, nor antagonize
their views of the fitness of things.</p>

<p>When Abner reached his boarding house, after making
his numerous calls, it was about five o'clock; as he went upstairs
he noticed that the door of Strout's room was ajar.
In response to his knock, the Professor said, "Come in."</p>

<p>"Wall, how do find things?" said Abner, as he entered
the room.</p>

<p>"By lookin' for 'em," said the Professor, with a jaunty
air.</p>

<p>"Oh, yer know what I mean," said Abner, throwing himself
into a chair and looking inquiringly at Strout.
"What was goin' on this noon 'tween you and that city
feller?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," continued Strout, "Mr. Sawyer and me
have been at swords' points the las' two months over some
pussonal matters. Well, he kinder wanted to fix up things,
but he knew I wouldn't consent to let up on him 'less he
treated me square; so I gets a third interest in the grocery
store, the firm name is to be Strout &amp; Maxwell, and I'm to
be postmaster; so, you see, I got the best end after all, jest
as I meant to from the fust. But, see here, Stiles, Mr.
Sawyer and I have agreed to keep our business and our
pussonal matters strictly private in the futer, and you
mustn't drop a word of what I've told yer to any livin'
soul."</p>

<p>"I've carried a good many of yer secrets 'round with
me," responded Abner, "and never dropped one of 'em,
as far as I know."</p>

<p>"Oh, yer all right, old man," said the Professor; "but,
yer know, for the last two months our game has been to
<a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a>keep talkin'; now it will pay us best to keep our mouths
shet."</p>

<p>"Mine's shut," said Abner; "now, what do I git? That
job in the grocery store that you promised me?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Strout, "when I made yer that
promise, I expected to own the whole store, but now, yer
see, Maxwell will want ter pick one of the men."</p>

<p>"Yis, I see," said Abner; "but that leaves one fer you to
pick, and I'm ready to be picked."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered Strout; "but the work is goin'
to be very hard, liftin' barrels and big boxes, and I'm afraid
you couldn't stand it very long."</p>

<p>A disappointed look came over Abner's face; he mused
for a moment, then he broke out, "Yes, I see; I'm all right
for light work, sech as tellin' lies 'bout people and spyin'
out their actions, and makin' believe I've seen things that I
never heard of, and hearin' things that were never said;
but when it comes to good, clean, honest work, like liftin'
barrels and rollin' hogshead's, the other feller gets the job.
All right, Professor!" said he, getting up and walking towards
the door; "when you want anythin' in my line, let me
know." And he went out and slammed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>As he went upstairs to his room, he said to himself, "I
have sorter got the opinion that the Professor took what
wuz given him, instid of gittin' what he asked fer. I kinder
guess that it'll pay me to be much more partickler about
number one in the futer than I've been."</p><p><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></p>

<h3>AUNT ELLA.<br /></h3>

<p>Deacon Mason had an early caller Wednesday
morning. He was out in the barn polishing up his
silver-plated harness, for he was going to the funeral
on Friday with his family. Hiram had given him notice
that he would have to go up to the store at once. The
Deacon didn't have anybody in mind to take Hiram's place,
and thought he might as well get used to doing his own
work until he came across the right party.</p>

<p>He heard a voice. It said, "Good mornin', Deacon
Mason;" and, looking up, he saw Abner Stiles standing
before him.</p>

<p>"Good mornin', Abner," answered the Deacon, pleasantly;
"what does the Professor want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Abner; "I heerd that Hiram was
goin' to leave yer, so I came 'round to see if yer wanted ter
hire a man."</p>

<p>"Do yer know of one?" asked the Deacon with a smile.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Deacon," said Abner. "I don't blame
yer fer havin' yer little joke. I've worked so long fer the
Professor that I expect to have it flung up at me. But I've
renounced the Evil One and all his wicked ways, and I
want to be taken into a good Christian home, and eventooally
jine the church."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
"While the lamp holds out to burn,<br />
&nbsp;The vilest sinner may return,"<br />
</div>

<p>quoted the Deacon, as he hung up one piece of harness
and took down another.</p><p><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a></p>

<p>"That's true as Gospel," said Abner; "and I hope you'll
see it's your duty, as I've heerd Parson Howe say, to save
the brand from the burnin'."</p>

<p>"Well, you go in and talk to Mrs. Mason," said the Deacon;
"she's the one that wants the work done, and if she's
satisfied to give yer a trial, it's all the same to me."</p>

<p>"Thank yer, Deacon," answered Abner. "There's one
p'int in my favor, Deacon; I hain't got no girl, and I sha'n't
take any of your time to go courtin';" and with this sly
dig at Hiram, he went in to settle his fate with the Deacon's
wife.</p>

<p>On that same Wednesday morning all of the Pettengill
family were together at the breakfast table. The conversation
naturally turned to Mrs. Putnam's death, and
Ezekiel remarked "that she was a nice old lady, and that
she and his mother were great friends. It beats all," continued
he, "the way Lindy has acted. Abner Stiles told me
that she took the half-past three train to Boston, and he
said Bob Wood took over an express wagon full of trunks.
Samanthy Green told Stiles that Lindy hadn't left a single
thing in the house that belonged to her, and it don't look as
though she was comin' back to the funeral."</p>

<p>During this recital, Alice listened intently. She flushed
then grew pale, and finally burst into tears. All present,
of course, attributed her agitation to her well known love
for Mrs. Putnam.</p>

<p>"Shall I go upstairs with you, Sis?" asked Ezekiel.</p>

<p>"No," said Alice, drying her eyes, "I'm going into the
parlor. I told Mandy to build a fire there, and I want you
and Uncle Ike and Mr. Sawyer to come with me."</p>

<p>When they were gathered in the parlor, Alice began her
story. Every word said by the dead woman had burned
itself deep into her memory, and from the time she entered
the sick room until she fell exhausted upon the stairway,
after calling loudly for Samanthy and Lindy, not a word
was missing from the thrilling narrative. Her audience,
<a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a>including even Quincy, listened intently to the dramatically
told story, and they could almost see the frenzied face,
the pointed finger, and hear the wild, mocking laugh.</p>

<p>For a few moments nothing was said. Finally, Ezekiel
broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess," said he, "that will of her'n will stand,
all right. Lindy's got enough of her own; she won't be
likely to interfere; and I never he'rd of their havin' any
other relatives."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Ike spoke up. "I shall go to the funeral, of
course, next Friday, and I shall expect to hear the Rev.
Mr. Howe stand up in his pulpit and tell us what a good
Christian woman Hepsy was; she was so kind and so benevolent,
and so regardful of the feelings of others, and it
wouldn't make a bit of difference if you went and told him
what you've told us, Alice; he'd say just the same thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! Uncle Ike," cried Alice, pleadingly; "she was
a good woman, excepting on that one point, and you must
own that she had some provocation. Let me ask you a
question, Uncle Ike. How far should promises made to
the dead be kept?"</p>

<p>"Just so far," replied Uncle Ike, "as they do not interfere
with the just rights of the living. Where is that letter
that she wanted you to destroy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Alice, and she took it from the bosom
of her dress.</p>

<p>"Well," said Uncle Ike, "if I were in your place I'd
open that letter, read it, and if it was likely to be of any
value to Miss Putnam in finding her parents or relatives,
I'd hunt her up and give it to her. Mrs. Putnam owned up
that she lied about it, and the whole thing, any way, may
be a bluff. Perhaps it's only blank paper, after all."</p>

<p>"No," said Alice, "I could never open it or read it. I
laid awake all night, thinking about my promise, and I
finally made up my mind that I would go to see Lindy this
morning, and let her read it; but now she has gone away,
<a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"></a>and we do not know where to find her. What shall I do
with this dreadful thing?" she cried, as she held the letter
up in her hand.</p>

<p>Quincy felt called upon to speak.</p>

<p>"Miss Pettengill," said he, "I think I could find Miss
Putnam for you." A slight flush arose to Alice's cheek
which did not escape Quincy's notice. He continued,
"When I went to Boston, last Saturday, I happened to
meet her on the train. She told me then something of her
story, and said she was going to leave the house forever, as
soon as Mrs. Putnam died. She also told me that if I ever
learned anything about her parents I could reach her by
advertising in the Personal Column of the New York
'Herald,' addressing 'Linda,' and signing it 'Eastborough.'"</p>

<p>"And will you do this at once for me?" cried Alice,
eagerly. "I am so thankful; you have taken such a load
from my mind, Mr. Sawyer. How fortunate it was that you
met her as you did?</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Sawyer is about as lucky as they make
'em," remarked! Uncle Ike, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Kind fortune owes me one or two favors yet before I
shall be entirely satisfied," said Quincy. "Now, Miss Pettengill,
will you allow me to make a suggestion that will
free you from the further care of this document?"</p>

<p>"I don't care what is done with it," said Alice; "but no
one but Lindy must read it."</p>

<p>"That is any idea exactly," assented Quincy. "I will go
to Boston on the noon train and send that advertisement
to the New York 'Herald,' With your permission, I will
turn that document over to a legal friend of mine. He will
put it in an envelope and seal it up. He will write on the
outside, 'To be delivered only to Miss Putnam, on the
written order of Miss Alice Pettengill,' and it will repose
quietly in his big safe until Miss Putnam is found."</p>

<p>"That will do splendidly!" said Alice, with animation.<a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a>
"What magicians you lawyers are! You discover a way
out of every difficulty."</p>

<p>"Wait until you get one of those lawyers working
against you," remarked Uncle Ike, "then you'll change
your mind. Well, I s'pose now this matter's settled, I can
go upstairs and have my morning smoke."</p>

<p>"And I've got to go to the store," said Ezekiel to Uncle
Ike, "and get some corn, or those chickens of your'n will
swaller the hen coop." And both men left the room together.</p>

<p>"If you can give me a little of your time, Miss Pettengill,"
said Quincy, "I have some news for you that I think
will please you very much."</p>

<p>"About my stories?" cried Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Quincy. "Just before I went to Boston
last Saturday I got a letter from Leopold, asking me to call
on him as soon as convenient. I found him at home Sunday
evening, and this is what he said. The New York
house has accepted your series of eight detective stories,
and will pay you twenty-five dollars for each of them. The
house will send you a check from time to time, as they publish
them. Leopold has accepted your long story for the
magazine published by the house for which he is reader.
He says Jameson will get your other story into one of the
Sunday papers, and he will have his dramatic version ready
for production next fall. He can't tell how much you will
make out of these just yet; the magazine pays by the page
and the newspaper by the column, and, of course, Jameson
will give you part of his royalty, if he gets the play
on."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Sawyer, you are showering wealth upon me
like another Count of Monte Cristo."</p>

<p>"But you have not heard all," continued Quincy. "Leopold
has placed your two songs with a music publishing
house, and you will get a royalty on them in time. He says
they don't pay any royalty on the first three hundred
<a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a>copies, and perhaps they won't sell; the public taste on
sheet music is very fickle. Then, that composer, I can
never remember his name, is at work on your poem, 'The
Lord of the Sea.' He told Leopold he was going to make
it his <i>opus vitae</i>, the work of his life, you know, and he is
talking it up to the director of the Handel and Haydn
Society."</p>

<p>"How true it is," said Alice, "that gladness quickly follows
sadness! I was so unhappy this morning", but now the
world never looked so bright to me. You have brushed
away all my sorrows, Mr. Sawyer, and I am really very
happy to hear the good news that you have told me."</p>

<p>"There is one sorrow that I have not yet relieved you
of," continued Quincy.</p>

<p>"And that?" asked Alice, brushing back the wavy golden
hair from her forehead, and looking up at him with her
bright blue eyes, which bore no outward sign of the dark
cloud that dimmed their vision,&mdash;"and that is?"&mdash;she repeated.</p>

<p>"That letter," taking the hand that held it in both of his
own. "If I am to get that noon train I have no time to
lose."</p>

<p>"Before you take it," said Alice, "you must promise me
that it shall not be opened, and no eye but Lindy's must
ever rest upon it."</p>

<p>"You have my word," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then take it," said she; and she released her hold upon
it.</p>

<p>He took the letter with one hand, his other hand still
retaining its grasp upon hers.</p>

<p>"I go," said Quincy, assuming a bantering tone, "upon
your quest, fair lady. If I return victorious, what shall be
my reward?"</p>

<p>"Gallant knights," said Alice, as she withdrew her hand
from his, "do not bargain for their reward until they have
fulfilled their trust."</p><p><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a></p>

<p>"I accept the reproof," said Quincy gravely.</p>

<p>"It was not so intended, Sir Knight," responded Alice
brightly; "so I will make amends by answering your query.
If you return successful, tell me what you would prize the
most, and even if it be half my kingdom, it shall be yours."</p>

<p>"I am content, but modern locomotives do not wait even
for gallant knights of old. So adieu."</p>

<p>He quitted the room, and Alice stood where he had left
her until she heard the rumble of wheels as he drove off for
the station; then she found her way to her chair before the
fire, and her mind wove the outline of a romantic story, in
which there was a gallant knight and a lovely maiden. But
in her story the prize that the knight asked when he returned
successful from his quest was the heart and hand of
the lovely maiden.</p>

<p>Jim Cobb went over to Eastborough Centre, so as to
drive the team back. Before going to the station, Quincy
stepped into the post office and found a letter addressed to
him in a peculiar, but familiar, handwriting.</p>

<p>"From Aunt Ella," he said. "I will read it after I get on
the train."</p>

<p>Quincy's Aunt Ella was Mrs. Robert Chessman, his
mother's widowed sister.</p>

<p>As soon as the train started Quincy opened his letter. It
was short and to the point.</p>

<p>
"My <span class="smcap">Dear Quincy</span>:&mdash;Maude gave me your address.
What are you doing in a miserable, little country town in
the winter? They are bad enough in the summer, but in
March!&mdash;'Bah! Come and see me at once, you naughty
boy!</p>
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Aunt Ella</span>."
</p>

<p>"Dated yesterday," said Quincy; "how fortunate. I will
go up to Mt. Vernon Street to-morrow noon and take
lunch with her."</p>

<p>When Quincy reached Boston he went directly to his
<a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"></a>father's office. The Hon. Mr. Sawyer was not present, but
his partners, Mr. Franklin Crowninshield and Mr. Atherton
Lawrence, were busily engaged. Quincy took a seat at
the desk which, he had occupied before going to Eastborough,
and wrote out his advertisement for the New York
"Herald." It read as follows: "Linda. Important paper
discovered; communicate at once with Q.A.S., Eastborough."</p>

<p>He enclosed a check to cover a fortnight's insertion;
then walked down State Street to the post office to mail his
letter. When he returned, Mr. Lawrence informed him
that his father was in his private office. His father greeted
him pleasantly, but not effusively; in fact, any marked exhibition
of approval or disapproval was foreign to the Sawyer
character, while the Quincys were equally notable for
their reticence and imperturbability.</p>

<p>"When shall we have the pleasure of your continued
presence at home?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"To-night," replied Quincy, with a smile, "I shall be with
you at dinner, stay all night, and take breakfast with you."</p>

<p>"I trust your long visit will not oblige you to neglect
other more important matters," said the father.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" answered Quincy. "I have looked out for
that."</p>

<p>"And when do you think your health will allow you to
resume your position in the office?" inquired the Hon.
Nathaniel.</p>

<p>"That is very uncertain," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"If you do not intend to come back at all," continued
the father, "that would simplify matters. I could then make
room for a Harvard graduate to study with us."</p>

<p>Quincy reflected. He had been taught by his father not
to give a positive answer to any question on the spur of the
moment, if more time could be taken, as well as not, for
consideration. So, after a few moments of thought, Quincy
<a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a>said, "I will write you in the course of ten days or a fortnight,
and give you a positive answer."</p>

<p>"That will be entirely satisfactory," answered his father.
"As you are going out, will you kindly tell Mr. Crowninshield
that I wish to consult with him?"</p>

<p>Quincy knew that the interview had expired by limitation.
He went home, but found that his mother and sisters
were out riding.</p>

<p>"They will return in time for dinner," said Delia, the
parlor maid.</p>

<p>Quincy went into the parlor and opened the grand piano.
He sat down before it, touched a few of the keys casually,
then sang, with great expression, the song by J.R. Thomas
entitled "Pleasant Memories." He next wandered into the
library, and took down and glanced at several books that
he had devoured with avidity when a boy of sixteen. Then
he went upstairs to his own room, which he had occupied
since he was eight years old. It looked familiar, everything
was in its accustomed place; still, the room did not
look homelike. Strange as it may seem, Quincy had been
happier in the large west chamber, with its old-fashioned
bureau and carpet and bed, than he had ever been in this
handsomely furnished apartment in the Beacon Street
mansion. There was no wide fireplace here, with ruddy
embers, into whose burning face he could look and weave
fanciful dreams of the fortune and happiness to be his in
the future.</p>

<p>He spent a pleasant evening with the family. His father
was present, but passed the time in reading the newspapers
and a legal brief that he wished to more closely examine.
His mother was engrossed in a new novel, but no approving
smile or sympathetic tear demonstrated any particular interest
in the fates of the struggling hero or suffering
heroine.</p>

<p>Florence sat at the piano, and, in response to Quincy's
request that she would give him some music, played over
<a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a>some chromatic scales and arpeggios. He declared that
they reminded him of grand opera, which remark sent
Maude into a fit of satirical laughter, and Florence up to
her room in a pout.</p>

<p>Then Maude fell to asking Quincy questions about himself,
to which he returned evasive and untruthful answers,
until she was, as she said, completely disgusted. Then she
dropped her head upon his shoulder, and with the arms of
the brother whom she dearly loved clasped around her, she
went to sleep. He looked at the sweet girlish face and
thought, not of her, but of Alice.</p>

<p>Next morning he was up early, for he knew that a busy
day was before him. The last thing before retiring, and
the first thing upon getting up, he examined his inside
vest pocket, to see if that precious letter, that priceless trust
that he had given his knightly word to deliver, was safe.</p>

<p>He breakfasted early, and eight o'clock found him in
Bowdoin Square, at the corner of Green and Chardon
Streets. His first visit was to a safe manufactory, a few
doors from the corner, where he purchased one for the
firm of Strout &amp; Maxwell.</p>

<p>After traversing both sides of Friend Street, he finally
settled upon two horses, stout country roadsters, and left
an order for their shipment to Eastborough Centre, when
they were notified that the wagons were ready. He bought
the wagons in Sudbury Street. They had red bodies and
yellow wheels, and the words, "Strout &amp; Maxwell, Mason's
Corner, Mass.," were to be placed on them in gold letters.</p>

<p>These tasks completed, Quincy walked up Tremont Row
by Scollay's Building. Crossing Pemberton Square, he
continued up Tremont Street until he came to the building
in which was the law office of Curtis Carter, one of his law
school chums.</p>

<p>"Hello, Curt!" said he, as he entered the somewhat dingy
office.</p>

<p>"Well, 'pon honor, Quincy," cried Curtis, "the sight of
<a name="Page_385" id="Page_385"></a>you is good for sore eyes, and I've got such a beastly cold
that I can't see with one eye and can't read with the other."</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I came in here intending to consult
you professionally, but I don't think a blind lawyer
will answer my purpose."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be all right in a few minutes," replied Curtis.
"I dropped into Young's as I came up and took an
eye-opener. What's the matter, old fellow, breach of
promise?"</p>

<p>Quincy took a seat near Curtis's desk.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "it's a case of animosity carried beyond
the grave."</p>

<p>"Oh! I see," said Curtis, "party cut off with a shilling,
going to try and break the will?"</p>

<p>"Have a cigar?" asked Quincy. "While you are lighting
it and getting it under way I may slide in and get a
chance to state my business."</p>

<p>"Oh! you want to do the talking?" said Curtis good
humoredly. "Well, go ahead, old man;" and he leaned
back and smoked complacently.</p>

<p>Quincy then related as much as he thought necessary of
the story of the sealed letter, and as he concluded he took
the package from his pocket and placed it on the corner of
the lawyer's desk.</p>

<p>"You are doing just right," said Curtis; "the probate
judges nowadays are looking more carefully at wills, especially
when their provisions indicate that the signer was
more red Indian than white Christian. I understand you
perfectly," he continued; "what you wish me to do is to
put this letter in an envelope, seal it securely, and endorse
upon it these words, 'To be delivered only to Miss Lindy
Putnam upon the written order of Miss Alice Pettengill.'"</p>

<p>"That's it exactly," said Quincy; "only I wish a receipt
from you for the document."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Curtis. As he raised the lid of his
old-fashioned desk the letter fell to the floor. The envelope
<a name="Page_386" id="Page_386"></a>had received rough treatment in its progress from
hand to hand, and it was not strange that when it struck
the floor one corner was split open by the fall.</p>

<p>As Quincy stooped to pick it up, he noticed that something
that resembled a small piece of white cloth dropped
from the broken corner of the envelope. When he picked
it up to replace it, he saw that it was a small piece of white
cotton cloth, and his quick eye caught the name "Linda
Fernborough" stamped thereon with indelible ink. He
said nothing, but replacing the piece of cloth passed the
package to Curtis, who enclosed, sealed, and endorsed it,
and gave a receipt therefor to Quincy.</p>

<p>"I will put this in my big steel vault," said he, as he went
into another room.</p>

<p>Quincy knew that Curtis would accept no fee for such a
slight service, so placing a five dollar greenback under a
paperweight, he quietly left the office and was out of sight
long before Curtis, with the bill in his hand, ran down stairs,
bareheaded, and looked up and down the street in search
of him.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Quincy reached his aunt's house. A
"Buttons," dressed in blue livery, opened the door, and
Quincy was ushered into the long parlor, which ran the
full depth of the house, some sixty feet, in which he had
passed many pleasant evenings. He sent up his card, and
in a few moments Buttons returned and delivered the
speech which Mrs. Chessman had taught him and which
he had learned by heart: "Mrs. Chessman desires that
you will come up at once."</p>

<p>Quincy bounded upstairs, to the evident astonishment of
Buttons, and made his way to the front chamber, which he
knew was his aunt's room. She loved the sunlight, and it
was a constant visitor in that room, summer and winter.
His aunt did not greet him with a "how do you do?" and a
hand-shake. Instead of such a formal reception, she gave
him a hearty hug and kissed him three times, once on the
<a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"></a>forehead, then on the cheek, and finally on the lips, in
which latter osculation Quincy took part.</p>

<p>His aunt led him to an easy-chair, then threw herself
upon a lounge opposite to him. She eyed him attentively
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Quincy," said she, "you are better looking than ever;
you're almost as good looking as Robert was, and he was
the handsomest man I ever saw. How many different
country girls have you kissed since you saw me last?"</p>

<p>"I kept the count," said Quincy, "till I went to a surprise
party a week ago Monday, and then I lost it."</p>

<p>"Of all the kisses that you have had, whose do you prize
the most?"</p>

<p>"Those from my beloved Aunt Ella," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>Aunt Ella smiled and said, "You know how to keep on
the right side of an old woman who has got money."</p>

<p>"I didn't think of that until you called my attention to it,"
said Quincy gravely.</p>

<p>"And I didn't believe it when I said it," added Aunt Ella.
A few moments later she rang and ordered a light lunch.
When this was over she went to an old secretary with brass
handles, opened a drawer, and took out a cigar box.</p>

<p>"I have a few of Robert's cigars left," she said.</p>

<p>Quincy took one and resumed his seat in the easy-chair.</p>

<p>Aunt Ella opened another drawer in the secretary and
took out a pouch of tobacco, a package of rice paper and a
box of wax tapers. She put these articles on a small diamond-shaped
table and placed the table between Quincy
and herself. She handed Quincy the match-box, then deftly
rolling a cigarette, she lighted it, leaned back upon the
lounge and blew rings of smoke into the air, which she
watched until they broke.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's horribly unbecoming for me to
smoke?" she asked, looking at Quincy.</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to express my real thoughts?" replied
Quincy, "or flatter you because you have money?"</p><p><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388"></a></p>

<p>Aunt Ella reddened a little, then said, "A good shot,
Quincy, but I deserve it. Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Ella," said he, "you are the only woman
whom I ever saw smoke who, in my opinion, knew how to
do it gracefully."</p>

<p>"I think you are sincere," she rejoined, "and I beg pardon
for wounding your feelings as I did before. Give me
your hand on it."</p>

<p>They shook hands as two men would have done after settling
differences.</p>

<p>Then she said, "Now draw your chair up closer, Quincy,
and tell me what you've been doing, and what other people
have been doing to you since the day before Christmas,
the last time I set eyes on you until to-day. You know I
am your mother confessor."</p>

<p>Quincy complied, and in his quiet, concise way gave her
a full account of his doings in Eastborough, omitting
nothing, concealing nothing. If anything, he gave fuller
details of his acquaintance with Huldy, Lindy, and Alice
than he did of the other portions of his story. He could
not forbear to give at full length the account of his final
settlement with the Professor.</p>

<p>Aunt Ella laughed heartily at some parts of the recital,
and looked sorrowful and sympathetic when she listened to
other portions. She rolled and smoked half a dozen cigarettes
during its continuance, and when she saw that Quincy
had finished his cigar she placed the remainder of the box
before him.</p>

<p>When he closed she said, "Quincy, you're a brick. I
haven't enjoyed myself so much for years. I do so love
anything that isn't commonplace, and your experience is
both novel and interesting. What a dear old man Deacon
Mason is, and Ezekiel Pettengill is a fine young fellow, honest
and square. That Hiram and Mandy must be a team.
Are they going to get married?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Quincy. "He stammers, you know,
<a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a>and I think he is afraid he will break down when he tries
to propose."</p>

<p>Aunt Ella laughed heartily; then she said, "What a constitutional
liar that Stiles must be, and as for the Professor,
I would like to have a set-to with him myself."</p>

<p>As she said this she doubled up her fists.</p>

<p>"Oh, he wouldn't meet you that way," said Quincy. "He
only fights with a woman's weapon, his tongue;" and he
told her of his little boxing match with Robert Wood.</p>

<p>Aunt Ella continued: "I can imagine what a pretty,
sweet, little country girl Huldy Mason is. My heart aches
for Lindy, her martyrdom has been out of all proportion to
her contemplated wrongdoing, if wrongdoing it really was.
Had I been in her place I would have married Jones and
left my clothes behind; and then," said Aunt Ella, "how
my heart goes out to that dear, sweet girl that you call
Alice! Do you love her, Quincy?"</p>

<p>"Devotedly," answered Quincy, "I never really loved a
woman before."</p>

<p>"Then marry her," cried Aunt Ella decidedly.</p>

<p>"Everybody at home but Maude will object," said
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Maude's the best one in the family, next to yourself,"
snapped Aunt Ella.</p>

<p>"They will bring up Uncle Jim," continued Quincy.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Aunt Ella. "Uncle Jim was a
fool; any man is a fool who thinks he can win the battle of
life by making a sot of himself. Bring this girl to me,
Quincy. She must be a genius, if she can write as you say
she can. Let me care for her and love her and make
life pleasant and beautiful for her until you get ready to do
it yourself."</p>

<p>"I will, some day, Aunt Ella. You are the best friend
I have in the world, and when I have the right to bring
Alice to you, I will lose no time in doing so. Thank you
for your kind words about her. I shall never forget them,
<a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a>and she shall hear them some day. But I must go now."</p>

<p>They both arose, "Promise that you will come and see
me every time you are in Boston, Quincy; if you don't, I
shall come down to Eastborough to see you."</p>

<p>She gave him another kiss at parting.</p>

<p>As he left the house he deliberated for a moment as to
where he should go next. It was half-past four. He decided
to go to Leopold's lodgings in Chestnut Street. He
found him at home, but for a wonder he was not working.</p>

<p>"This is an off day with me," he explained; "this is our
haying season, and I've been working nights, days, and
Sundays for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"I came to express Miss Pettengill's obligations and
thanks for your kind and very successful efforts in her behalf."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's all right," said Leopold. "By the way, have
you told her she ought to write a book?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Quincy; "but I'm going to soon. She
has just lost a dear friend; but I won't forget it."</p>

<p>"Don't!" repeated Leopold. "She is a diamond that
ought to be dug up, cut, and set in eighteen carat gold.
Excuse my apparently brutal language, but you get my
meaning."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Quincy; "and you are not working to-day."</p>

<p>"No," replied Leopold; "loafing and enjoying it, too.
I've a good mind to turn vagrant and loaf on, loaf ever."</p>

<p>"Come down to Parker's and have dinner with me."</p>

<p>"Can't do it," replied Leopold; "my stomach is loafing,
too. 'Twouldn't be fair to make it work and do nothing
myself. Just as much obliged. Some other day. Don't
forget the book," he cried, as Quincy left the room.</p>

<p>Quincy took his dinner at Parker's, caught the five minutes
past six express, and reached Eastborough Centre at
half-past seven. Abbott Smith drove him home to the
Pettengill house.</p><p><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></p>

<p>The next day was Friday. Everybody at Mason's Corner,
with quite a number from Eastborough and Montrose,
came to Mrs. Putnam's funeral. The little Square in front
of the church, as well as the shed, was filled with teams.
While waiting for the arrival of the body, quite a number
of the male residents of Mason's Corner were gathered
upon the steps of the church.</p>

<p>Strout spied Abner Stiles and approached him. "Bob
Wood has jest told me," said the Professor, "that he has decided
not to leave his present place, so I've concluded on
second thoughts to give yer that job at the grocery store."</p>

<p>Abner's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"I've had my second thoughts, too," said he, "I've hired
out to Deacon Mason for life, and if I jine the church he
says I can work for him in the next world. So I kinder
guess I shall have to decline yer kind invitation to lift boxes
and roll barrels."</p>

<p>When the services were over every person in the church
passed up the centre aisle to take a last view. Her husband
had been buried in the Montrose cemetery, and she
had told Mr. Tilton that she was to be laid by his side. The
Eastborough cemetery was in West Eastborough, and for
that reason many of the late residents of Mason's Corner
slept their last sleep at Montrose.</p>

<p>As they stood by the coffin, Alice said, "How does she
look?"</p>

<p>"Very pleasant," replied Quincy; "there is a sweet smile
upon her face."</p>

<p>"I am so glad," said Alice. She pressed his arm a little
tighter, and looking up to him, she said, "Perhaps she has
met her boy, and that smile is but the earthly reflection of
the heavenly one that rests upon her face in her home
above."</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied Quincy; and they walked slowly out
of church and took their places on the rear seat of the Pettengill
carryall, Ezekiel and Uncle Ike sitting in front.</p><p><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"></a></p>

<p>Mandy Skinner and Mrs. Crowley had not gone to the
funeral The latter was busy skimming cream from a
dozen large milk pans, while Mandy sat before the kitchen
stove, with Swiss by her side. She was thinking of Hiram,
and wondering if he really intended to ask her to marry
him.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's been foolin' me, but now he's goin'
into business I should think it was about time for him to
speak up or quit."</p>

<p>Swiss suddenly arose, sniffed and went to the kitchen
door. The door was opened softly and some one entered
the room. Mandy did not turn her head. Perhaps she
guessed who it was. Then some one placed a chair close
to Mandy and took a seat beside her.</p>

<p>"Say, M-m-m-m-m-a-andy," said Hiram, "will you please
read this to me? It's an important document, and I want
to be sure I've got it jest right." As he said this he passed
Mandy a folded paper.</p>

<p>She opened it and the following words met her eye:
"This is to certify that I, Hiram Maxwell, of Mason's Corner,
in the town of Eastborough, county of Normouth, and
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, hereby declare my intention
to ask Miss Amanda Skinner of the village, town,
county, and state aforesaid, to become my lawful wedded
wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, you big silly!" cried Mandy, dropping the paper,
for she didn't think it necessary to read any further.</p>

<p>"Is it all right?" cried Hiram, "it cost a quarter to git it
drawn up. Then I swore to it before old Squire Rundlett
over to Montrose, and it ought ter hold water. You'd better
keep it, Mandy, then I can't fling it up at yer that I
never axed yer to marry me."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" asked the girl indignantly.</p>

<p>"Ma Hawkins. Well, she didn't exactly say it to me, but
she spoke it out so loud to Betsy Green that I heered it
<a name="Page_393" id="Page_393"></a>clear out in the wood-shed and I'll tell yer what, Mandy,
it kinder made me mad."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right now," said Mandy soothingly.</p>

<p>"Is it?" asked Hiram, his face beaming with delight.</p>

<p>The next instant there was a succession of peculiar
sounds heard in the room. As Swiss came back from the
kitchen door but one chair was needed for the happy couple,
and an onlooker would have thought that chair was occupied
by one person with a very large head, having light
curly hair on one side and straight dark hair on the other,
no face being visible.</p>

<p>It was upon this picture that Mrs. Crowley looked as she
opened the door leading into the kitchen and started to
come into the room with a large pan full of cream.</p>

<p>Astonished, she stepped backward, forgetting the two
steps that she had just ascended. Flat upon her back she
fell, the pan of cream drenching her from head to foot.</p>

<p>"It's drownded I am! It's drownded I am!" she cried at
the top of her voice.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? How did it happen?" said Mandy,
as she rushed into the room, followed by Swiss.</p>

<p>"Shure it's thinkin' I was," moaned Mrs. Crowley,
"when the milk fell on me."</p>

<p>"Thinkin' of what?" cried Mandy sharply. "You couldn't
have been thinkin' of your business."</p>

<p>"Shure I was thinkin' of the day when Pat Crowley and
I both sat in the same chair, forty years ago," said Mrs.
Crowley, rising to her feet and wiping the cream from her
eyes, and nose, and ears.</p>

<p>During this time Swiss was busily engaged having a rich
feast upon the cream left in the pan. Hiram appeared at
the kitchen door to learn the cause of Mandy's absence.</p>

<p>Raising her hands high in the air, Mrs. Crowley said,
"Bless you, my darlints; may yer live long and may all the
saints pour blessin's on yer hids."</p><p><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a></p>

<p>And with this invocation the poor old woman hobbled
off to her room in the ell and was not seen again until the
next morning.</p><p><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a></p>

<h3>THE WEDDIN'S.<br /></h3>

<p>The next day was Saturday. While the Pettengill
family was at breakfast, Squire Rundlett arrived.
He had driven over from Montrose with the partnership
papers for Strout, Hiram, and Quincy to sign and also the
will of the late Mrs. Hepsibeth Putnam.</p>

<p>As he came into the kitchen he espied Mandy, and a
broad smile spread over his face as he said, "Good morning,
Miss Skinner, was that paper all right?" Mandy flushed
scarlet but said nothing. "Honestly, Miss Skinner," said
the Squire, "I think it was a very sensible act on Hiram's
part. If men were obliged to put their proposals in writing
there wouldn't be any more breach of promise cases."</p>

<p>"I think he was a big goose," finally ejaculated Mandy,
laughing in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"At any rate," continued the Squire, "he knew how to
pick out a smart, pretty little woman for a wife;" and he
raised his hat politely and passed into the dining-room.</p>

<p>Here he was asked to have some breakfast. He accepted
a cup of coffee, and, while drinking it, informed Quincy
and Alice of the twofold purpose of his visit.</p>

<p>Quincy led Alice into the parlor, the Squire accompanying
them. Quincy then retired, saying he would join the
Squire in a short time and ride up to the store with him.</p>

<p>When they were alone, the Squire informed Alice that
by the terms of Mrs. Putnam's last will she had been left
sole heiress of all the real and personal property of the deceased.
The dwelling house and farm were worth fully
ten thousand dollars, while the bonds, stocks, and other
<a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"></a>securities, of which he had had charge for many years, were
worth at least forty thousand more. For several years
Mrs. Putnam's income had been about twenty-five hundred
dollars a year.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of her to leave it to me," said Alice;
"I have never done anything to deserve it and I would not
take it were it not that I understand there are no near relatives,
and that Miss Lindy Putnam was amply provided for
by her brother."</p>

<p>There was a knock upon the door, and Quincy looked in.</p>

<p>"Come in, Mr. Sawyer," said the Squire. "I have an
important bit of news for you that concerns this young
lady."</p>

<p>Quincy did as requested and stood expectantly.</p>

<p>The Squire went on: "Mrs. Putnam's old will, made
some six years ago, gave all the property to Miss Pettengill,
but provided that its provisions should be kept secret
for ninety days. In that will I was named as sole executor."</p>

<p>"Why did she change it?" asked Alice earnestly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the Squire. "About three weeks
ago she sent for me and cut out the ninety-day restriction
and named our young friend here as co-executor with
myself."</p>

<p>Alice remained silent, while a look of astonishment crept
into Quincy's face.</p>

<p>"I do not quite comprehend her reason for making this
change," remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Putnam was a very far-seeing lady," said the
Squire, with a laugh, looking first at Alice and then at
Quincy.</p>

<p>A slight flush mounted to Alice's cheeks, and Quincy
said coolly, "I do not perceive the application of your remark."</p>

<p>"Easy enough," said the Squire, seeing that he had put
his foot in it, and that it was necessary to explain his false
step in some way; "easy enough. I have had sole charge
<a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a>of her property for six years, and she wished some cool-headed
business man to go over my accounts and see if I
had been honest in my dealings with her."</p>

<p>"That way of stating the case is satisfactory," said
Quincy, a little more genially.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am in danger of being robbed with two
such trusty guardians," said Alice.</p>

<p>Then all three laughed, and the little rift was closed.
But the Squire's words had not been unheeded and two
hearts were busily thinking and wondering if he had really
meant what he said.</p>

<p>The Squire then turned to Quincy. "If you will name
a day we will go over to the county town, present the will
for probate, and at any time thereafter my books will be
ready for inspection."</p>

<p>Quincy named the following Wednesday, and then both
men congratulated Miss Pettengill on her good fortune,
bade her good morning, and then started to go to the store.</p>

<p>As they passed through the kitchen Mandy was not in
sight. She evidently did not intend to have a second interview
with the Squire.</p>

<p>When they reached the store they found Strout and
Hiram and Mr. Hill and his son already there. The business
with Mr. Hill was soon concluded, and he delivered
the keys of the property to Squire Rundlett; then the co-partnership
papers were duly signed and witnessed, and
then the Squire passed the keys to Mr. Obadiah Strout, the
senior partner of the new firm of Strout &amp; Maxwell, who
formally took possession of the property in his own name
and that of his partners.</p>

<p>Since Abner's curt declination of a position in the store,
Strout had been looking around for some one to take his
place, and had finally settled upon William Ricker, or, as
he was generally called, Billy Ricker, a popular young
resident of Montrose, as it was thought he could control a
great deal of trade in that town.</p><p><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"></a></p>

<p>For a similar reason, Quincy and Hiram had united in
choosing young Abbott Smith, who was known by everybody
in Eastborough Centre and West Eastborough.
Abbott had grown tired of driving the hotel carriage and
wished to engage in some permanent business.</p>

<p>The choice was naturally not particularly palatable to
Strout, but he had consented to let bygones be bygones and
could offer no valid objection. These two young men were
to report for duty that Saturday evening, and the close of
that day's business terminated Benoni and Samuel Hill's
connection with the grocery store.</p>

<p>Sunday morning all of the Pettengill family went to
church and listened to a sermon by Mr. Howe, the minister,
from the text, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall
inherit the kingdom of Heaven."</p>

<p>As they were driving home, Uncle Ike remarked in his
dry, sarcastic way, "I s'pose Mr. Howe was thinkin' of Mrs.
Putnam when he was praisin' the peacemakers; it's a fashion
in the country, I understand, the Sunday after a funeral
to preach in a general way about the departed one."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Putnam has been very kind to me," protested
Alice, "and you should forgive her for my sake."</p>

<p>"I'll forgive her," said Uncle Ike, "when the wrong she
has done has been righted." He shut his teeth together
sharply, faced the horses again, and lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Quincy joined Alice in the parlor, and
they sang some sacred music together.</p>

<p>Quincy picked up a book from the table and said, "Why,
Miss Pettengill, by this turned down corner I imagine
there are some thirty pages of this very interesting story,
'The Love of a Lifetime,' that I have not read to you.
Would you like to have me finish it this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I have been afraid to hear the last chapter," said Alice.
"I fear Herbert and Clarice will both die, and I so hate a
book with a sad ending. Why don't authors keep their
lovers alive&mdash;"</p><p><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399"></a></p>

<p>"Marry them off and let them live happily ever afterward,"
Quincy concluded.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could ever write a book with a sorrowful
conclusion," mused Alice.</p>

<p>Quincy saw the opportunity for which he had long
waited.</p>

<p>"Why don't you write a book?" asked he earnestly.
"My friend Leopold says you ought to; he further said
that you were a genius, and if I remember him correctly,
compared you to a diamond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the rough," added Alice quickly.</p>

<p>"That's it," said Quincy; "but Leopold added that rough
diamonds should be dug up, cut, and set in a manner worthy
of their value."</p>

<p>"I am afraid Mr. Ernst greatly overrates my abilities and
my worth," said she, a little constrainedly. "But how unkind
and ungrateful I am to you and Mr. Ernst, who have
been so kind and have done so much for me. I will promise
this much," she continued graciously. "I will think it
over, and if my heart does not fail me, I will try."</p>

<p>"I hope your conclusion will be favorable," remarked
Quincy. "In a short time you will be financially independent
and freed from any necessity of returning to your
former vocation. I never knew of an author so completely
successful at the start, and I think you have every encouragement
to make literature your 'love of a lifetime.'"</p>

<p>"I will try to think so too," replied Alice softly.</p>

<p>Then he took up the book and finished reading it. When
he had closed, neither he nor she were thinking of that
future world in which Herbert and Clarice had sealed those
vows which they had kept so steadfastly and truly during
life, but of the present world, bright with promise for each
of them, in which there was but one shade of sorrow&mdash;that
filmy web that shut out the beauties of nature from
the sight of that most beautiful of God's creations, a lovely
woman.</p><p><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"></a></p>

<p>Monday morning Quincy made another trip to Boston.
He had obtained the measurements for a large sign, upon
which, on a blue ground, the words "Strout &amp; Maxwell"
were to appear in large gold letters. He paid another visit
to the carriage factory, and ordered two leather covered
wagon tops, to be used in stormy weather, and picked out
two sets of harness resplendent with brass buckles and
bosses and having "S. &amp; M." in brass letters on the blinders.</p>

<p>He reached Aunt Ella's in time for lunch. He told her
of the approaching wedding of Ezekiel and Huldy; then,
leaning over, he whispered something in her ear, which
made her face beam with delight.</p>

<p>"What a joke it will be," cried she, "and how the country
folks will enjoy it. Can't I come down to the wedding,
Quincy, and bring my landau, my double span of cream-colored
horses, and my driver and footman in the Chessman
livery? I'll take you and your lady love to the church."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," said Quincy. "I'll ask Miss Mason
to send you an invitation."</p>

<p>"Let me do something to help," begged the impetuous
but good-hearted Aunt Ella. "Bring the girls up some
morning early. We will go shopping, then we'll lunch
here. We will have to go without our wine and cigars
that day, you know, and then we'll go to the modiste's and
the milliner's in the afternoon. We'll make a day of it,
young man."</p>

<p>Quincy leaned back in his easy-chair and blew a ring of
blue smoke from one of Uncle Robert's cigars.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Aunt Ella," said he, "but do you ever intend
to get married again?"</p>

<p>"Quincy Adams Sawyer!" cried Aunt Ella, with an astonished
look on her face, "are you joking?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Quincy. "My question was intended
to be a serious and respectful inquiry. You are
only forty, fine looking, well educated, well connected and
wealthy. Why should you not?"</p><p><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"></a></p>

<p>"I will answer you seriously then, Quincy. I could not
marry again. Ten years' life with Robert Chessman was
a greater pleasure than a lifetime with an ordinary man.
I was twenty-five when I married him; we lived together
ten years; he has been dead for five. How often I have
wished that Robert had lived to enjoy his fortune with me.</p>

<p>"But he was satisfied," she continued. "'Better be a
success at the end,' he used to say, 'than be a success in middle
life and fall from your greatness. Look at Wolsey,
look at Richelieu, look at Napoleon Bonaparte.' He would
often remark: 'Earth has no sadder picture than a broken
idol.' He used to consider Abraham Lincoln the most successful
man that ever lived, for he died before making a
mistake, and when he was strongest in the hearts of the
people.</p>

<p>"Your question reminds me," continued Aunt Ella, "of
something I had in mind to say to you at some future day,
but I may as well say it now. How much money have
you, Quincy, and what is your income?"</p>

<p>"Father gave me fifty thousand dollars outright when I
was twenty-one; it pays on an average six per cent. Besides
this he allows me two thousand a year for supposed
professional services rendered in his law office."</p>

<p>"That makes five thousand a year," said Aunt Ella
quickly. "Well, I'll allow you five thousand more a year,
and the day you are married I'll give you as much outright
as your father did. That's unconditional. Now, conditionally,
if you bring your wife here and live with me you
shall have rooms and board free, and I'll leave you every
dollar I possess when I'm through with it. Don't argue
with me now," she continued, as Quincy essayed to speak.
"Think it over, tell her about it. You will do as you please,
of course, but I shall not change my mind on this point."</p>

<p>"Didn't your husband leave any relatives that might
turn up and prevent any such disposition of your property?"</p><p><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a></p>

<p>"When we married, Robert said he was alone in the
world," replied Aunt Ella; "he had no sisters, and only one
brother, named Charles. Charles was an artist; he went
to Paris to study about thirty-five years ago. From there
he went to London. Some thirty years ago Robert got a
letter from him in which he said he was going to return to
America. Robert waited, but he did not come; then he
wrote again to his English address, but the letter was returned
with the words 'Gone to America' endorsed
thereon."</p>

<p>"Was he married?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Robert never knew," said Aunt Ella, "but he imagined
not, as Charlie, as he called him, never spoke in his letters
of being in love, much less of being married."</p>

<p>Quincy caught the three o'clock train to Eastborough
Centre, and Ellis Smith, another son of 'Bias Smith, who
had taken the hotel carriage in place of his brother Abbott,
drove him home.</p>

<p>A few days thereafter invitations to the wedding of
Ezekiel Pettengill and Hulda Ann Mason were sent broadcast
through Eastborough Centre, West Eastborough,
Mason's Corner, and Montrose. Then it was decided by
the gossips that Ezekiel was going to have Mr. Sawyer and
Hiram Maxwell and Sam Hill to stand up with him, while
Huldy Ann was going to have Alice Pettengill, Mandy
Skinner, and Tilly James as bridesmaids.</p>

<p>The whole town turned out when the two gaudy wagons,
with their handsome horses and fine harness reached Eastborough
Centre, and a number of Centre folks followed
the unique procession over to Mason's Corner. One of
the wagons contained the new sign, which was soon put
in place, and was a source of undisguised admiration for a
long time.</p>

<p>On the tenth of April, Strout &amp; Maxwell's two heavy
teams went over to Eastborough Centre and returned about
noon heavily loaded, followed by three other teams from
<a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a>the Centre equally well filled. Then Mr. Obadiah Strout
could contain himself no longer. He let the cat out of the
bag, and the news spread like wildfire over the village, and
was soon carried to Eastborough Centre and to Montrose.
The Mason's Corner church was to have a new organ, a
present from Mr. Sawyer, and Professor Obadiah Strout
had been engaged to officiate for one year.</p>

<p>The nineteenth of April was fixed for Huldy's wedding
day. The hour was ten in the morning. As early as eight
o'clock teams began to arrive from north, east, south, and
west. Enough invitations had been issued to fill the church,
and by half-past nine every seat was taken.</p>

<p>The little church was profusely decorated with vines,
ferns and potted plants, while a wealth of cut flowers
adorned the altar, the front of the new organ, which rose
towering to the very top of the church, and the pews
reserved for the bridal party.</p>

<p>Outside the edifice hundreds of sightseers, not honored
with invitations, lined both sides of the spacious Square in
front of the church, and occupied positions of vantage on
the steps.</p>

<p>It lacked but ten minutes of ten. The sexton rung a
merry peal from the sweet-toned bell, which was the pride
of the inhabitants of Mason's Corner. Within the church
the ushers, having attended to the seating of the audience,
stood just within the door awaiting the arrival of the bride
and groom. They were in dress suits, with white gloves,
and each had a white rose in his butonhole. Robert Wood
and Cobb's twins had been assigned to the right of the
centre aisle, while Abbott Smith, Benjamin Bates, and
Emmanuel Howe had charge of the left side of the edifice.
If any noticed the absence of Samuel Hill and Hiram Maxwell,
it did not provoke general remark, although Mrs.
Hawkins asked Jonas if he'd seen Mandy anywhere, and
Tilly James's school chum, Eliza Allen, managed to occupy
two seats, so as to have one for Tilly when she came.</p><p><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a></p>

<p>At exactly five minutes of ten, Professor Strout emerged
from the rear of the platform and proceeded towards the
new organ. He, like the ushers, was in a dress suit, with a
white rose in the lapel of his coat. He was greeted with
applause and bowed his acknowledgements. He took his
seat at the organ and played a soft prelude, during which
the Rev. Caleb Howe entered and advanced to the altar.</p>

<p>Then loud cheers were heard from the assembled crowd
outside. The organ stopped and the sexton again filled
the air with merry peals. The sight outside was one which
those inside could not see, and therefore could not appreciate.
What was that coming up the road? Mason's Corner
had never seen an equipage like that before. An open
carriage, drawn by four cream-colored horses, with white
manes and tails and silver-tipped harness. A coachman
in livery sat upon the box, while a footman, in similar
livery, rode behind. Following behind this were other carriages,
containing the other members of the bridal party.</p>

<p>Within the church every eye was turned upon the door
through which the party was to come. Professor Strout's
sharp eye saw the first couple as they reached the entrance,
and the strains of Mendelssohn's Wedding March, that
have preceded so many happy bridals, sounded through
the church. The party included Ezekiel and Huldy, Deacon
Mason and wife, Mr. Sawyer and Miss Alice Pettengill,
and a handsome, richly dressed lady unknown to
any of the villagers, who was escorted by Mr. Isaac Pettengill.</p>

<p>Ezekiel and Huldy advanced and took their positions
before the minister, while the remainder of the party took
seats in one of the bridal pews.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over the audience naturally
expected that the wedded couple would leave the church
by the right-hand aisle, on both sides of which, from end
to end, white silk ribbons had been drawn to keep the passage
clear.</p><p><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"></a></p>

<p>But no! Shouts and cheers were again heard from
outside the church, again the church bell rang out, and
once more the melody of the Wedding March fell upon the
ears of the Professor's auditors, while to their astonishment
Ezekiel and his wife seated themselves quietly in the
front bridal pew. Again every eye was turned, every neck
was craned, and Samuel Hill and Tilly James walked down
the centre aisle and took their places before the clergyman.
Again the solemn words were spoken, and this time the
spectators felt sure that the double couple would leave the
church by the silken pathway.</p>

<p>But no; again were cheers and shouts from the outside
borne to the excited spectators within. Once more the
sexton sent out pleasing tones from the church bell; once
more the Professor evoked those melodious strains from
the sweet-toned organ; and as Samuel Hill and his wife
took their seats in the front pew beside Mr. and Mrs. Ezekiel
Pettengill, the excitement of the audience could no
longer be controlled. It overcame all restraint, and as
Hiram Maxwell and Mandy Skinner entered, the people
arose to their feet and cheered loudly, as they would have
done at a political meeting or a circus.</p>

<p>Again, and for the last time, the Rev. Mr. Howe went
through the time-honored ceremony, and at its close Mr.
and Mrs. Ezekiel Pettengill, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Hill,
and Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Maxwell left the church by way
of the right-hand aisle, preceded by the ushers, who strewed
the aisle with white roses as they advanced, and were followed
by the occupants of the second bridal pew.</p>

<p>As Quincy rode over to Eastborough Centre with his
Aunt Ella, after partaking of the wedding breakfast, which
was served in Deacon Mason's dining-room, she remarked
to him that the events of the day had been most enjoyable,
and that she didn't know, after all, but that she should
change her mind about getting married again.</p>

<p>When asked by Quincy if she had seen any one whom
<a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"></a>she thought would suit her for a second husband, she replied
that "Mr. Isaac Pettengill was a very well-preserved
old gentleman, and the most original man in thought and
speech that she had met since Robert died."</p>

<p>Quincy did not inform her that Uncle Ike had a wife
and two grown-up daughters living, thinking it best to reserve
that information for a future occasion.</p>

<p>That night Strout &amp; Maxwell's grocery store was the
centre of attraction. Strout was in his glory, and was, of
course, in his own opinion, the most successful feature of
that eventful day. It was a very common thing to get
married, but it was a most uncommon thing to play on a
new church organ, and play as well as he had done, "for
the first time, too," as he remarked a score of times.</p>

<p>Stepping upon a barrel, the Professor called out in a
loud voice, "Order, please," and in a short time the assembled
crowd became quiet.</p>

<p>"Friends and Feller Citizens: I have this day received
my commission as postmaster at Mason's Corner, Mass.
Mail matter will be sorted with celerity and delivered only
to the proper parties, while the firm of Strout &amp; Maxwell
will always keep on hand a full assortment of the best
family groceries at reasonable prices. Soliciting your continued
patronage, I remain, yours respectively.</p>

<p class="right1">
<span class="smcap">Obadiah Strout</span>, Postmaster.
</p>

<p>As the Professor stepped down from the barrel, Abner
Stiles caught him by the arm and said in a low voice,
"Isn't Deacon Mason one of your bondsmen?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Strout, somewhat pompously, "but what of
it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yer see," said Abner, "I'm workin' for the Deacon
now, and I'm just as devoted to his interests as I used
to be to yourn onct, and with a much better hope of reward,
both on this earth and in Heaven, and if he's got money
<a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a>put up on yer, of course yer won't object if I drop in onct
in a while and kinder keep an eye on yer." And with this
parting shot he dashed out a side door and was lost to
sight.</p><p><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a></p>

<h3>BLENNERHASSETT.<br /></h3>

<p>When comparatively great events follow each other
in quick succession, those of minor importance are
liable to escape mention. It was for this reason, probably,
that the second visit of Dr. Tillotson was not spoken of at
the time of its occurrence. He examined Alice's eyes and
declared that progress towards recovery was being made,
slowly but surely. He left a bottle of new medicine, and
advised Alice, as an aid to recovery, to take a long walk,
or a ride, each pleasant day. This advice he repeated to
Uncle Ike, who was waiting for him outside the front door,
and to Quincy, who brought him from the station and took
him back.</p>

<p>On the day fixed upon, Quincy drove over to Montrose,
and accompanied by Squire Rundlett, went to the county
town and presented Mrs. Putnam's will for probate. In
due time the will was admitted, the executors' bonds were
filed and approved, and Quincy, at the age of twenty-three,
found himself one of the financial guardians of the young
heiress, Mary Alice Pettengill, she being his junior by less
than two years.</p>

<p>About ten days after Quincy's interview with his Aunt
Ella, in which she had signified her intention of making
him an allowance, he received a letter from a Boston banking
firm, informing him that by direction of Mrs. Ella
Chessman, the sum of five thousand dollars had been placed
to his credit, and that a similar sum would be so placed
on the first business day of January in each succeeding
year. A blank card was enclosed for a copy of his signature,
<a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"></a>and the statement made that his drafts would be duly
honored.</p>

<p>When Quincy and his aunt reached Eastborough Centre,
after the trio of weddings, they found that they had a
full hour to wait before the arrival of the next ingoing
train.</p>

<p>This gave plenty of time for the reloading of the horses
and carriage on the special car in which they had been
brought from Boston and which had been side-tracked.</p>

<p>Quincy wished to accompany his aunt to Boston and
escort her to her home, but she demurred. He insisted,
but his aunt replied, "Don't go, please don't, Quincy; they
will take me for your mother, and I really am not quite old
enough for that."</p>

<p>This argument was unanswerable, and Quincy bade her
a laughing good-by as the train sped on towards Boston,
the special car in charge of the coachman and footman
bringing up the rear.</p>

<p>Thus Aunt Ella's visit to Mason's Corner became an
event of the past, but the memory of it remained green for
a long time in the minds of those who had witnessed her
arrival and departure.</p>

<p>Ellis Smith drove Quincy home to the Pettengill house.
It was to be home no longer, for Hiram and Mandy were
to have the room that Quincy had occupied so long. His
trunk and other belongings he had packed up the night
before, and at Quincy's request, Cobb's twins had taken
them out to Jacob's Parlor, where he found them. He
knew that Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins were to spend the afternoon
with their daughter and son-in-law.</p>

<p>Quincy also knew that Uncle Ike and Alice were at
Deacon Mason's, where Ezekiel and Huldy were to remain
for the coming week.</p>

<p>For the first time since he had been at Mason's Corner,
Quincy felt lonesome and deserted. He reflected on his
way to Mrs. Hawkins's boarding house that these weddings
<a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"></a>were all very nice, to be sure, but they had deprived him
of the society of many good friends, who were now united
by stronger ties than those of simple, everyday friendship.</p>

<p>He did not care to go to the grocery store, for he felt
that the Professor was entitled to all the credit that he was
likely to get for his day's performance, and he did not wish
to detract from it. So he went directly to his room, and
for the first time felt out of sorts with Eastborough and its
people.</p>

<p>He was not hungry for food, so he did not answer the
call to supper, but sat in the dark and thought. He realized
that he was hungry, yes, desperately hungry, for love&mdash;the
love of one woman, Alice Pettengill. Why should
he wait longer? Even if his father and mother objected his
Aunt Ella was on his side, and her action had made him
independent. He had felt himself so before, but now there
was no doubt of it.</p>

<p>This determined young man then made up his mind he
would declare his love at the first auspicious moment.
Then he would go to his parents and learn their verdict
on his proposed action. Thinking thus he went to bed,
and in his dreams, ushers, and bridesmaids, and cut flowers,
and potted plants, and miles of silken ribbon, and cream-colored
horses, and carriages, and clergymen, and organists,
and big pipe organs were revolving about him and
Alice, as the planets revolve about the sun.</p>

<p>Once more Quincy's breakfast was on the stove being
kept warm, and once more Mrs. Hawkins was waiting impatiently
for him to come down.</p>

<p>Betsy Green and she were washing the breakfast dishes.
How happy Eve must have been in Eden, where there was
no china, no knives and forks, and no pots and kettles, and
what an endless burden of commonplace drudgery she entailed
upon her fair sisters when she fell from her high
estate. Man's labor is uniformly productive, but woman's,
alas! is still almost as uniformly simply preservative.</p><p><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"></a></p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer," said Mrs. Hawkins to Betsy Green, "is
no doubt a very nice young man, but I shouldn't want him
for a steady boarder, 'less he got up on time and eat his
meals reg'lar."</p>

<p>"I s'pose he's all tired out," remarked Betsy. "He had
a pretty hard day of it yesterday, you know, Mis' Hawkins."</p>

<p>"Wall, I s'pose I ought to be kinder easy on him on that
account. I must say he managed things fust rate."</p>

<p>"How did the brides look?" asked Betsy.</p>

<p>Poor girl, she was one of the few who were not able to
view the grand sight.</p>

<p>"I can think of no word to express my feelin's," replied
Mrs. Hawkins after a pause, "but splendiferous! Huldy's
dress was a white satin that would a stood alone. She had
a overskirt of netted white silk cord, heavy enough to use
for a hammock. You know she's neither light nor dark,
kind of a between, but she looked mighty poorty all the
same."</p>

<p>"Was Tilly James dressed in white, too?" inquired Betsy.</p>

<p>"No," answered Mrs. Hawkins. "She wore a very light
pink silk, with a lace overskirt, and it just matched her
black eyes and black hair fine, I can tell yer."</p>

<p>"Mandy must have looked pretty, with her light curly
hair and blue eyes, and those rosy cheeks."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Hawkins reflectively, "I'm her mother,
and a course I'm prejoodished, but I honestly think she
was the best lookin' one of the three. Of course Hiram
is no beauty, and I'm all out of patience when he tries to
talk to me. But I know he'll make Mandy a good husband,
and that's a tarnal sight better'n good looks."</p>

<p>"What color was Mandy's dress?" persisted Betsy.</p>

<p>"Lord a massy," cried Mrs. Hawkins, "I e'en a'most forgot
to tell yer. Her dress was a very light blue silk, with
a lace overskirt, 'bout the same as Tilly's. Mr. Sawyer
gave her two hundred dollars to buy her things with, 'cause
<a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a>she's been so nice to him since he boarded at Pettengill's."</p>

<p>"Who was that stylish lookin' lady that came in a carriage
with the four beautiful horses? I saw her outer the
attic winder."</p>

<p>"She was a Mrs. Chessman," replied Mrs. Hawkins. I
heern tell she's a widder'd aunt of Mr. Sawyer's, and she's
as rich as Creazers."</p>

<p>"How rich is that?" inquired Betsey, with an astonished
look.</p>

<p>"Creazers," replied Mrs. Hawkins, with an expression
that savored of erudition, "was a man who was so all fired
rich that he had to hire folks to spend his money for him."</p>

<p>At that moment a step was heard in the dining-room,
and both Mrs. Hawkins and Betsy flew to wait upon the
new-comer who proved to be Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer.
As he took his seat at the table the Connecticut clock on
the mantelpiece struck ten.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that same morning Mr. Sawyer
knocked at the front door of Mr. Ezekiel Pettengill's residence.
How strange it seemed, how much more homelike
it would have been to have entered by the back door
and to have come through the kitchen and dining-room, as
of old. But no! He was not a regular boarder now, only
an occasional visitor.</p>

<p>The door was opened by young Mrs. Maxwell, and her
usually rosy cheeks were ruddier than ever when she saw
who the caller was.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Pettengill in?" Quincy politely inquired.</p>

<p>"She's in the parlor, sir; won't you walk in?" And she
threw open the door of the room in which Alice sat by the
fire.</p>

<p>"Do I disturb your dreams, Miss Pettengill?" asked
Quincy, as he reached her side.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you have come, Mr. Sawyer," said Alice,
extending her hand. "I never was so lonesome in my life
as I have been this morning. The house seems deserted.<a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a>
Uncle Ike ate too many good things yesterday, and says he
is enjoying an attack of indigestion to-day. I had Swiss in
here to keep me company, but he wouldn't stay and Mandy
had to let him out."</p>

<p>"He came up to Mrs. Hawkins's," said Quincy, as he
took his accustomed seat opposite Alice. "He walked
down with me, but when he saw me safe on the front doorstep
he disappeared around the corner."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell him to go after you," said Alice, laughing;
"but I am very glad that you have come. I have a very
important matter to consult you about. You know you
are my business man now."</p>

<p>"I'm always at your service," replied Quincy. "I think
I know what you wish to see me about."</p>

<p>"And what do you think it is?" asked Alice, shaking her
head negatively.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I saw Squire Rundlett the day
before the weddings and he thought that you might possibly
want some money. He had a thousand dollars in
cash belonging to you, and I brought you half of it. If
you will kindly sign this receipt," he continued, as he took
a small parcel from his pocket, "you will relieve me of
further responsibility for its safe keeping."</p>

<p>He moved the little writing table close to her chair, and
dipping the pen in the ink he handed it to her, and indicated
with his finger the place where she should sign. She
wrote as well as ever, though she could see nothing that she
penned.</p>

<p>"There are eight fifty-dollar bills, eight tens and four
fives," he said, as he passed her the money.</p>

<p>"Which are the fifties?" she asked, as she handled the
money nervously with her fingers.</p>

<p>"Here they are," said Quincy, and he separated them
from the rest of the bills and placed them in her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you," said she. She counted out four of the
bills and passed them to Quincy. "That settles my money
<a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a>debt to you, does it not?" she inquired; "but nothing can
pay the debt of gratitude that I owe you for your many
acts of kindness to me, Mr. Sawyer."</p>

<p>"I am fully repaid by that very kind speech of yours,"
replied Quincy. "But what was the important matter you
wished to see me about? I don't think it was the money."</p>

<p>"It was not," said Alice. "I have little use for money
just at present. I never had so much before at once in all
my life. I shall have to learn to be an heiress."</p>

<p>"It's a lesson that is very easily learned," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"What I wish to speak about," continued Alice, musingly,
"is Mrs. Putnam's house. I could never live in it. I
could never go into that room again;" and she shuddered.</p>

<p>"You can sell it," interposed Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," said Alice earnestly, "I am going to give it away.
Father just made a living here, and Ezekiel can do no better,
but with the Putnam farm, properly stocked, he can
in time become a rich man, for he is a good farmer, and he
loves his work. I wish," continued Alice, "to give 'Zekiel
and Huldy the farm outright, then I would like to loan him
enough money to buy live stock and machinery and whatever
else he may need, so that he may begin his new life
under the most favorable auspices."</p>

<p>"I think your proposed action a most commendable
one," remarked Quincy. "I am sure you need anticipate
no objections on the part of Squire Rundlett or myself.
Our duties are limited to seeing that all the property that
was willed to you is properly delivered. It gives us no
right to interfere with your wishes or to question your motives.
I will see Squire Rundlett at an early day and have
the matter put into shape. Does Ezekiel know of this?"</p>

<p>"Not a word," said Alice; "I do not wish to speak to him
about it until the matter is all settled and the papers are
signed. He is high spirited, and at the first mention I know
he would refuse my offer, especially if he thought 'twas
only known to us two. But when he learns that the deed is
<a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a>done, and that the Squire and yourself are knowing to it,
he will be more tractable."</p>

<p>"Speaking of the Putnam house, or more properly, I
suppose, Pettengill house number two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This will always be number one," interposed Alice.</p>

<p>"&mdash;reminds me," said Quincy, that my efforts to discover
Lindy's whereabouts have so far proved unavailing. The
advertisement that I put in for a month has run out and
I have received no word."</p>

<p>"Do you think she went to New York, as she promised?"
inquired Alice.</p>

<p>"I do not," replied Quincy. "I think she always had an
idea that Mrs. Putnam had some letter or document in her
possession relating to her parents. I think the poor girl
lost hope when she learned that it was destroyed, and I
imagine that she has intentionally hidden herself and does
not wish to be found. I might, after long search, discover
her bankers, but she has probably notified them to keep her
address a secret. I do not like to confess," he continued,
"to so abject a failure, but I really do not know what to
do next."</p>

<p>"We must wait and hope," said Alice. Then looking up
at Quincy with an arch smile upon her face, she added,
"I will extend your time, Sir Knight. Your gallant efforts
have so far been unsuccessful, but I shall pray that you may
some day return victorious."</p>

<p>Quincy replied in the same tone of banter: "Knowing
that you, fair lady, are ever thinking of me, and that my
name is ever upon your fair lips in prayer, will spur me to
renewed effort, for surely no cavalier ever had a more lovely
mistress or a greater incentive to knightly action."</p>

<p>Although he spoke in a chaffing tone, there was an undercurrent
of seriousness in his manner and pathos in his voice
that made Alice start and flush visibly.</p>

<p>Fearing that he had gone too far he quickly changed the
<a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a>subject by asking abruptly, "Have you come to any decision
about your book?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Alice, "and I am ashamed to say that
your friend's suggestion and your warm endorsement of it
have so increased my egotism and enlarged my appreciation
of my own abilities that I am tempted to try it, especially
now, as you inform me I am independent and can do
as I please."</p>

<p>"Have you progressed so far as to fix upon a subject?"
inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Yes, provisionally," replied Alice. "I have always been
a great admirer of history, and particularly that of my own
country. For the period from 1776, no, from 1607, to
the present time I have become conversant with the
thoughts and acts of our patriots and public men. One
character has always been a mystery to me, and I wish to
learn all I can about him."</p>

<p>"And he?" questioned Quincy.</p>

<p>"Is Aaron Burr," said Alice. "How I wish I could learn
the truth about the loss of his daughter Theodosia; then
the real reasons for his duel with Alexander Hamilton
are not fully understood at the present day. Then again, I
should enjoy writing about that fine old Irish gentleman
and lover of science, Harman Blennerhassett, and his lovely
wife, Margaret."</p>

<p>"Have you decided upon the title?" still further questioned
Quincy.</p>

<p>"I have thought of two," she replied, "'Theodosia,' and
'Blennerhassett,' but I strongly incline to the latter."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Quincy, "but you will have to do much
more reading, no doubt, before you commence writing.
Historical novels are usually savagely attacked by the
critics, presumably very often from political motives, and
you would have to be very strong in your authorities."</p>

<p>"That is what troubles me," said Alice; "if I only could
read&mdash;"</p><p><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417"></a></p>

<p>"But others can read to you and make such notes as you
desire," remarked Quincy. "I should like nothing better
than to help you in such a work, but I have been away from
home so long that I feel it imperative to resume my business
duties at an early day."</p>

<p>"I think you ought," said Alice. "I could not presume
to trespass upon your kindness and good nature to such an
extent. The idea of writing this book has grown very
pleasing to me, but I can wait until&mdash;" She stopped speaking
and placed both of her hands over her eyes. "I can
wait," she repeated, "until my eyes are better."</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to make a suggestion, Miss Pettengill?"</p>

<p>Alice smiled and nodded. "You are my literary as well
as my financial adviser," said she.</p>

<p>"It will no doubt appear quite an undertaking to you,"
continued Quincy, "but I shall be very glad to help you.
My plan is to secure a lady who reads well and can write a
good hand to assist you. Besides this, she must understand
correcting proof sheets. I think Leopold could easily find
such a person for you. Then, again, you know what Dr.
Tillotson said about your taking exercise and fresh air.
The second feature of my plan, and the most important in
my mind, is to find some quiet place in the country, or at
the beach, where you and your amanuensis can both work
and play. I can buy for you such books as you need, and
you can finish the work this summer."</p>

<p>Alice reflected. After a few moments' pause she said,
"I like the plan and I thank you very much for speaking of
it; but I prefer the beach. I love the plash and roar and
boom of the water, and it will be a constant inspiration to
me. How soon can I go?" she asked, with a look upon her
face that a young child might have had in speaking to its
father.</p>

<p>This was Alice Pettengill's great charm. She was honest
and disingenuous, and was always ready to think that
<a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a>what others deemed it best for her to do was really so. Imitation
may be the sincerest flattery, but appreciation of the
advice and counsel of others, combined with gratitude for
the friendly spirit that prompts it, makes and holds more
friends.</p>

<p>Quincy looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"I can get the afternoon train, I think," said he. "I will
see Leopold, and then run up and make Aunt Ella a call.
She knows the New England coast from Eastport to Newport.
Did she speak to you at the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Some lady with a very pleasant voice asked me if I
were Miss Pettengill, while we were in the church," replied
Alice. "I said yes, and then she told me that her
name was Chessman, adding the information that she was
your aunt, and that you could tell me all about her."</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to," said Quincy; "but I can assure
you it would be much more enjoyable for you to hear it
from herself. I hope you will have that pleasure some
day." And again adopting a bantering tone, "I trust, fair
lady, I shall not return this time from a bootless errand."</p>

<p>Alice listened again, as she had often done, until she
heard the sound of departing wheels, and then she fell to
wondering whether her future paths in life would continue
to be marked out by this Sir Knight, who was ever at her
beck and call, and whether it was her destiny to always
tread the paths that he laid out for her.</p>

<p>Quincy was fortunate in finding Leopold at home.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come, Quincy," said he; "I was going
to write you to-night."</p>

<p>"What's up?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Please pass me that package of papers on the corner of
the table," answered Leopold, being loath to rise from his
recumbent position on the lounge.</p>

<p>Quincy did as requested and took a seat beside Leopold.</p>

<p>"These," said Leopold, "are the proofs of the first writings
of a to-be-famous American author. Glad she took a
<a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a>man's name, so I don't have to say authoress. Here," he
continued, "are the proofs of the story, Was it Signed?
Cooper wishes it read and returned immediately. Editors
wish everything done immediately. They loaf on their end
and expect the poor author to sit up all night and make up
for their shortcomings. I'm a sort of editor myself, and I
know what I'm talking about. This lot," he continued,
"will appear in 'The Sunday Universe' a week from next
Sunday. I had a copy made for Jameson to work from.
Bruce Douglas owes me four-fifty for expenses, necessary
but not authorized."</p>

<p>"I will see that you are reimbursed," said Quincy; "want
it now?" and he made a motion to take out his pocketbook.</p>

<p>"No," replied Leopold, "I'm flush to-day; keep it till
some time when I'm strapped. Last, and most important
of all, here are the proofs of the story that is to appear in
our monthly. Now, my advice to you is, Quincy, seek the
fair author at once, correct these proofs and have them
back to me within three days, or they'll go over and she'll
be charged for keeping the type standing, besides having
her pay hung up for another week."</p>

<p>"She won't mind that," said Quincy, with a laugh. "She's
an heiress now, with real and personal property valued at
fifty thousand dollars. But what am I to do?" asked he
seriously. "I could read the manuscript, but we have no
one at Eastborough who knows how to make those pothooks
and scratches that you call 'corrections.'"</p>

<p>"Well, you two young aspirants for literary fame are in
a box, are'nt you? I was thinking about that fifty thousand.
Perhaps I'd better go home with you and get acquainted
with the author," said Leopold with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," returned Quincy, "it would be very kind of you
in our present emergency, but, strange as it may seem, I
came to see you this afternoon about securing a literary assistant
for Miss Pettengill. She has decided to write that
book."</p><p><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a></p>

<p>"Good girl!" cried Leopold, sitting bolt upright upon the
lounge. "I mean, good boy, for it was, no doubt, your acknowledged
powers of argument and gently persuasive
ways that have secured this consummation of my desire.
Let me think;" and he scratched his head vigorously. "I
think I have it," said he, finally. "One of our girls down
to the office worked so hard during our late splurge that
the doctor told her she must rest this week. She rooms
over on Myrtle Street. I happened to be late in getting out
one day last week, and we walked together up as far as
Chestnut Street. She lives nearly down to the end of
Myrtle Street."</p>

<p>"No further explanation or extenuation is necessary,"
said Quincy. "Is she pretty?"</p>

<p>"You're right, she is," replied Leopold, "She's both
pretty and smart. She has a beautiful voice and writes a
hand that looks like copperplate. She's a first-class proof
reader and a perfect walking dictionary on spelling, definitions,
and dates. They treat her mighty shabby on pay,
though. She's a woman, so they gave her six dollars a
week. If she were a man they'd give her twenty, and think
themselves lucky. I'll run over and see if she is at home.
At what time could she go down with you to-morrow?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I'll come after her at nine o'clock. Tell her Miss Pettengill
will give her eight dollars a week, with board and
lodging free."</p>

<p>"All right," cried Leopold, "that's business. While I'm
gone just see how pretty those stories look in cold type.
I've been all through them myself just for practice."</p>

<p>Leopold dashed out of the room and Quincy took up the
proofs of the story, Was It Signed? He became so absorbed
in its perusal that Leopold pulled it out of his hand
in order to attract his attention.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said. "She's delighted at the idea of
going. She thinks the change will do her good. She can't
<a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"></a>build up very fast in a little back room, up three flights."</p>

<p>"What's her name?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh! I forgot," replied Leopold. "I'll write her name
and address down for you. There it is," said he, as he
passed it to Quincy. "Her first name is Rosa, and that's all
right. She's of French-Canadian descent, and her last
name is one of those jawbreakers that no American can
pronounce. It sounded something like Avery, so she called
herself at first Rosa Avery; then the two A's caused trouble,
for everybody thought she said Rose Avery. Being a
proof reader," continued Leopold, "she is very sensitive, so
while the name Rosa satisfied her inmost soul, the name
Rose jarred upon her sensibilities. Thus another change
became necessary, and she is now known, and probably will
continue to be known, as Miss Rosa Very, until she makes
up her mind to change it again."</p>

<p>"I'm greatly obliged, Leopold," said Quincy, making the
proofs into a flat parcel and putting them into his inside
overcoat pocket.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, old fellow," remarked Leopold. "You
may be the means of supplying me with an assistant some
day. If you should, don't fail to call my attention to it."</p>

<p>Aunt Ella was at dinner when Quincy arrived. She
sent word up by Buttons for Quincy to come down to the
dining-room at once. She was alone in the room when he
entered.</p>

<p>"Just in time," said he, "and I'm hungry as a bear."</p>

<p>"That's a good boy; sit down and help me out," said his
aunt. "These extravagant servants of mine cook ten times
as much as I can possibly eat."</p>

<p>"I don't imagine it is wasted," replied Quincy.</p>

<p>"I think not," said Aunt Ella, with a laugh; "for, judging
from the extra plentiful supply, they probably have a
kitchen party in view for this evening. But what keeps you
away from Eastborough over night?"</p><p><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"></a></p>

<p>"I thought you couldn't eat and talk at the same time,"
remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"I can't," she replied. "I'm through eating and I'm going
to sit and listen to you. Go right ahead, the servants
won't come in. I won't let them stand and look at me when
I'm eating. If I want them I ring for them."</p>

<p>Quincy then briefly related the principal events that had
taken place at Mason's Corner since the nineteenth, remarking,
incidentally, that he had received no word from
Lindy.</p>

<p>"Let her alone, and she'll come home when she gets
ready," said Aunt Ella. "As to the best place for your
young lady to go, I shall have to think a minute. Old
Orchard is my favorite, but I'm afraid it would be too noisy
for her there, the hotels are so close to the railroad track. I
suppose your family, meaning your mother's, of course, will
go to Nahant, as usual. Sarah would have society convulsions
at Old Orchard. I should like to see her promenading
down in front of the candy stores, shooting for cigars
in the shooting gallery, or taking a ride down to Saco Pool
on the narrow-gauge; excuse me for speaking so of your
mother, Quincy, but I have been acquainted with her much
longer than you have." She went on, "Newport is too stylish
for comfort. Ah! I have it, Quincy. I was there three
years ago, and I know what I'm talking about. Quaint
place,&mdash;funny looking houses, with little promenades on
top,&mdash;crooked streets that lead everywhere and nowhere,&mdash;very
much like Boston,&mdash;full of curiosities,&mdash;hardy old
mariners and peaceable old Quakers,&mdash;plenty of nice milk
and eggs and fresh fish,&mdash;more fish than anything else,&mdash;every
breeze is a sea breeze, and it is so delightfully quiet
that the flies and mosquitoes imitate the inhabitants, and
sleep all day and all night."</p>

<p>"Where is this modern Eden, this corner lot in Paradise?"
asked Quincy; "it can't be part of the United States."</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Aunt Ella; it's off shore, I forget
<a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a>how many miles, but you can find it swimming around
in the water just south of Cape Cod."</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean Nantucket," cried Quincy.</p>

<p>"That's the place," assented his aunt. "Now, Quincy,
I'll tell you just what I want you to do, and I want you to
promise to do it before I say another word."</p>

<p>"That's a woman's way," remarked Quincy, "of avoiding
argument and preventing a free expression of opinion
by interested parties; but I'll consent, only be merciful."</p>

<p>"What I'm going to ask you to do, Quincy Sawyer, is for
your good, and you'll own up that I've been more than a
mother to you before I get through."</p>

<p>"You always have been," said Quincy, seriously. "Of
course, I love my mother in a way, but I'm never exactly
comfortable when I'm with her. But when I'm with you,
Aunt Ella, I'm always contented and feel perfectly at
home."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my dear boy," she said. Then, rising, she
went behind his chair, leaned over and kissed him on the
forehead; then, pulling a chair close to him, she went on:
"I haven't spoken to you of her, Quincy, because I have
had no opportunity until now. I've fallen in love with her
myself. I am a physiognomist as well as a phrenologist.
Robert taught me the principles. She's almost divinely
lovely. I say almost, for, of course, she'll be still lovelier
when she goes to Heaven. Her well-shaped head indicates
a strong, active, inventive mind, while her pure heart and
clean soul are mirrored in her sweet face. She is a good
foil for you, Quincy. You are almost dark enough for a
Spaniard or an Italian, while she is Goethe's ideal Marguerite."</p>

<p>It was not necessary for Quincy to ask to whom she referred,
nor to praise her powers of discernment. It was
Aunt Ella's time for talking, and she was not inclined to
brook any interference. So she went on.</p>

<p>"I want you to bring her here to me and have Rosa<a name="Page_424" id="Page_424"></a>
What-d'yer-call-her come with her. Here they can work
and play until you get the nest ready for her down to Nantucket.
You say she plays and sings. I love music passionately,
but I can't play a note, even on a jew's-harp; but if
she plays a wrong note I shall feel inclined to call her attention
to it. When I used to go to the theatre with Robert, I
delighted in telling him how badly some of the members of
the orchestra were playing, but I repented of it. He got in
the habit of going out between the acts to escape the music,
he said, and I never could keep him in his seat after that."</p>

<p>Quincy laughed heartily at this. "I see no way of stopping
this bad habit that gentlemen have of going out between
the acts," said he, "unless you ladies combine, and
insist on a higher grade of orchestral excellence."</p>

<p>"I have a large library," continued Aunt Ella, "and she
may find many books in it that will be of use to her. Robert
spent eighteen thousand dollars on it, and I've bought a
couple of thousand dollars' worth more since his death.
Now, what do you say, Quincy? You know I will do all in
my power to make her comfortable and happy while she is
here. If Maude runs up, and she's the only one that is
likely to, I will tell her that I have friends here from England.
I will keep her out of the way. Will you bring her?"</p>

<p>"If she will come, I will," Quincy replied.</p>

<p>"You will never repent it," said Aunt Ella. "Now let
us go upstairs."</p>

<p>When they reached her room the cigars and cigarettes
were again in requisition.</p>

<p>"I kept my promise the other day, Quincy," said she,
"when the three girls were here. What a sweet, rosy-cheeked,
healthy, happy trio they were! I wasn't more than
twenty myself that day. I give you my solemn promise,
Quincy, that I won't smoke a cigarette nor drink a glass of
wine while Alice is here,&mdash;until after she goes to bed; and
then I'll eat a clove and air the room out thoroughly before
I let her in in the morning."</p><p><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"></a></p>

<p>Quincy was up early next morning, and at ten minutes of
nine reached the lodging house in Myrtle Street. He had
taken a carriage, for he knew Miss Very would have her
luggage, probably a trunk. His call at the door was answered
by a sharp-eyed, hatchet-faced woman, whose face
was red with excitement. To Quincy's inquiry if Miss Very
was in, the woman replied, "that she was in and was likely
to stay in."</p>

<p>"I trust she is not sick," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"No! she ain't sick," the woman replied, "what you mean
by sick; but there's worse things than bein' sick, especially
when a poor widder has a big house rent to pay and coal
seven dollars and a half a ton."</p>

<p>A small trunk, neatly strapped, stood in the hallway.
Glancing into the stuffy little parlor, he saw a woman, apparently
young, with her veil down, seated on a sofa, with
a large valise on the floor and a hand bag at her side.</p>

<p>Quincy divined the situation at once. Stepping into the
hallway, he closed the parlor door, and, turning to the
woman, said, "How much?"</p>

<p>"Three dollars," replied the woman, "and it's cheap
enough for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A miserable little dark stuffy side room, without any
heat, up three flights, back," broke in Quincy, as he passed
her the money.</p>

<p>The woman was breathless with astonishment and anger.
Taking advantage of this, Quincy opened the parlor door,
first beckoning to the coachman to come in and get the
trunk.</p>

<p>"Miss Very, I presume?" said Quincy, as he advanced
towards the young lady on the sofa.</p>

<p>She arose as he approached, and answered, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Come with me, please," said he, grasping the valise.
She hesitated; he understood why. "It's all right," he said,
in a low tone. "I've settled with the landlady, and you can
settle with me any time."</p><p><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a></p>

<p>"Thank you, so much," spoke a sweet voice from underneath
the veil, and the owner of it followed close behind
him, and he handed her into the carriage. As Quincy
pulled the carriage door to, that of the lodging house closed
with a report like that of a pistol, and Mrs. Colby went
down stairs and told the servant, who was scrubbing the
kitchen floor, what had occurred, and added that she "had
always had her suspicions of that Miss Very."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While Quincy was talking with Alice the day before, his
dinner that Mrs. Hawkins had saved for him was being
burned to a crisp in and on the stove. Mrs. Hawkins's attention
was finally attracted to it, and, turning to Betsy,
she said, "Law sakes, somethin' must be burnin'." Running
to the stove, she soon discovered the cause. "Mercy
on me!" she ejaculated. "I left that damper open, and his
dinner's burnt to a cinder. Wall, I don't care; he may be a
good lodger, an' all that, but he's a mighty poor boarder;
and it's no satisfaction gittin' up things for him to eat, and
then lettin' them go to waste, even if he does pay for it.
Them's my sentiments, and I'll feel better now I've spit it
out."</p>

<p>The good woman went to work to clean up her stove,
while Betsy kept on with the seemingly endless dish washing.
Mrs. Hawkins finished her work, and, going to the
sink, began to wipe the accumulated pile of dishes.</p>

<p>"I s'pose everybody in town will go to church next Sunday,"
said Mrs. Hawkins, "to see them brides."</p>

<p>"Will they look any different than they did the other
day?" Betsy innocently inquired.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess," remarked Mrs. Hawkins. "I saw
Mandy yesterday and she told me all about her trip to the
city. Mrs. Chessman went shoppin' with them, and the
way she beat them shopkeepers down was a sight, Mandy
says. It beats all how them rich folks can buy things so
much cheaper than us poor people can. She took them all
<a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a>home to dinner, and Mandy says she lives in the most
beautifulest house she ever saw. Then she went to the
dressmakers with them, and she beat them down more'n
five dollars on each gown. Then she took 'em to the millinery
store, and she bought each one of them a great big
handsome hat, with feathers and ribbons and flowers all
over 'em. Nobody has seen 'em yet, but all three on 'em
are going to wear 'em to church next Sunday, and won't
there be a stir? Nobody'll look at the new orgin."</p>

<p>"I wish I could go," said Betsy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawkins rattled on: "Mandy says she took 'em all
into a jewelry store, and bought each one on 'em a breast-pin,
a pair of earrings, and a putty ring, to remember her
by. Then she druv 'em down to the deepo in her carriage."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see them with all their fine things on,"
said Betsy, again.</p>

<p>"Well, you shall, Betsy," said good-hearted Mrs. Hawkins.
"I'll make Jonas help me wash the dishes Sunday
mornin', and you shall go to church."</p>

<p>Betsy's face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>"You're so good to me, Mrs. Hawkins," she cried.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Mrs. Hawkins, "you've worked like a
Trojan the last week, and you deserve it. I guess if I go up
in the attic I can git a good look at them as they're walking
home from church."</p>

<p>In her excitement the old lady dropped a cup and saucer
on the floor, and both mistress and maid went down on
their hands and knees to pick up the pieces.</p><p><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428"></a></p>

<h3>"THE BIRD OF LOVE."<br /></h3>

<p>The carriage containing Quincy and Rosa was driven
at a rapid rate toward the station. There was no
time to lose, as some had already been lost in the altercation
with Mrs. Colby. They had proceeded but a short
distance, when Rosa took out a pocketbook, and, lifting
her veil, turned her face to Quincy.</p>

<p>What a striking face it was! Large, dark blue eyes, regular
features, a light olive complexion, with a strong dash of
red in each cheek, full red lips, and hair of almost raven
blackness. Like lightning the thought flashed through
Quincy's mind, "What a contrast to my Alice!" for he always
used the pronoun when he thought of her.</p>

<p>"Allow me to cancel part of my indebtedness to you,"
said Rosa, in a low, sweet voice, and Quincy again thought
how pleasant that voice would be to Alice when Miss Very
was reading to her.</p>

<p>As Rosa spoke she handed Quincy a two-dollar bill and
seventy-five cents in currency.</p>

<p>"I owe you an explanation," she continued. "Mr. Ernst
told me that I must be ready to accompany you the moment
you called, so I packed and strapped my trunk last
evening. When I returned from breakfast this morning I
looked through my pocketbook, and found to my surprise
that I lacked a quarter of a dollar of enough to pay for my
week's lodging. In my haste I had put my jewel case,
which contained the greater part of my money, in my trunk,
and I realized that there would not be time to unpack and
pack it again before your arrival. I offered Mrs. Colby the
<a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"></a>two seventy-five, and told her I would send her the balance
in a letter as soon as I arrived at my destination. To my
astonishment, she refused to take it, saying that she would
have the three dollars or nothing."</p>

<p>"If I had known that," said Quincy, "she would have got
nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh! it's all right," remarked Rosa, with a smile. "I
know the poor woman has hard work to make a living, and
I also know that she has lost considerable money from persons
failing to pay at all or paying part of their bills and
then not sending the balance, as they promised to do."</p>

<p>"And did she get up all that ugliness for a quarter of a
dollar?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh! that wasn't the reason at all," replied Rosa; "I've
always paid her promptly and in advance. She was mad
because I was going away. If she lets the room right off
she will get double rent this coming week, for it so happened
my week ended last night."</p>

<p>"Lodging-house keepers," said Quincy, "seem to be a
class by themselves, and to have peculiar financial and
moral codes. Here we are at the station," he added, as the
carriage came to a stop.</p>

<p>As Quincy handed Rosa from the carriage, his observant
eye noticed that the hand placed in his was small and well-gloved,
while the equally small feet were encased in a pair
of dainty boots. "She is true to her French origin," he
soliloquized, as they entered the station,&mdash;"well-booted,
well-gloved. I am glad she is a lady."</p>

<p>The train was soon on its way to Eastborough. It was an
accommodation, and Quincy had plenty of time to point
out the objects of interest on the way. Rosa was not a lover
of the country. She acknowledged this to Quincy, saying
that she was born and educated in the country, but that she
preferred paved streets and brick sidewalks to green lanes
and dusty roads.</p><p><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a></p>

<p>Alice had not waited for Quincy's return to broach the
matter of the gift of the Putnam house to Ezekiel and
Huldy. She had simply asked Quincy, so as to assure herself
that there was no legal objection or reason why she
should not make the transfer.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning she told her uncle that
she wished to have a talk with him in the parlor, and when
they were alone together, she stated her intentions to him,
as she had to Quincy. The old gentleman approved of her
plan, only suggesting that it should be a swap; that is, that
Ezekiel should deed the house in which they were, in
which, in fact, she owned a half-interest, to her, so she
would be sure of a home in case she lost part of her money,
or all of it, or wished to live in the country.</p>

<p>Most opportunely, Ezekiel and Huldy came over that
morning to make a call, and the matter was soon under discussion
in family conclave.</p>

<p>Ezekiel at first objected strenuously to the gift. He
would buy the house, he said, and pay so much a year on it,
but both Alice and Uncle Ike protested that it was foolish
for a young couple to start in life with such a heavy debt
hanging over them.</p>

<p>The only circumstance that led him to change his mind
and agree to accept the Putnam homestead as a gift was
Uncle Ike's suggestion that he deed the Pettengill homestead
to Alice, and pay her all he received for the sale of
products from the present Pettengill farm; but 'Zekiel
would not accept any loan. He said Deacon Mason had
given his daughter five thousand dollars outright, and that
would be all the cash they would need to stock and carry on
both the farms.</p>

<p>Then 'Zekiel said he might as well settle on who was to
live in the two houses. He knew that Cobb's twins would
like to stay with him, and he would take them up to the
Putnam house with him. Mrs. Pinkham had been hired
<a name="Page_431" id="Page_431"></a>by the executors to remain with Samanthy until some one
came to live in the house. Ezekiel said Samanthy was a
good girl, and he and Huldy both liked her, and he felt
pretty sure she'd be willing to live with them, because she
was used to the house, and as it was the only one she'd
ever lived in, it would seem like going away from home if
she left there and went somewhere else.</p>

<p>Then 'Zekiel was of the opinion that Abbott Smith and
Billy Ricker had better board with Hiram and Mandy, because
the grocery teams and horses would have to be kept
in the Pettengill barn, as there was no stable to the grocery
store. "'Twon't be stealin' anythin' from Mrs. Hawkins if
they don't board with her, cuz none of 'em ever lived with
her afore."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, 'Zekiel," asked Huldy, "that Uncle
Ike ought to come down stairs and have a better room? It
will be awful hot up there in the summer. Alice and I used
to play up there, and in July and August it was hot enough
to roast eggs, wasn't it, Alice?"</p>

<p>Alice, thus appealed to, said it might have been hot
enough, but she was positive that they never did roast any
up there, although she remembered setting the attic floor
on fire one day with a burning glass. 'Zekiel remembered
that, too, and how they had to put new ceilings on two
rooms, because he used so much water to put the fire out.</p>

<p>When Uncle Ike got a chance to speak, he said to Huldy,
"Thank you, my dear Mrs. Pettengill," with a strong accent
on the Mrs., which made Huldy blush a rosy red, "but
I wouldn't swap my old attic for all the rest of the rooms
in the house. My old blood requires warmth, and I can
stand ninety-six without asking for a fan. When I come
up to see you, you can put me in one of your big square
rooms, but I sha'n't stay long, because I don't like them."</p>

<p>The noise of wheels was heard, and Huldy ran to the
window to look out.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's Mr. Sawyer," said she; "and he's got a young
<a name="Page_432" id="Page_432"></a>lady with him, and she's got a trunk. I wonder who she
is? Do you know, Alice?"</p>

<p>"I don't know who she is," replied Alice; "but I can
imagine what she's here for."</p>

<p>"Is it a secret?" asked Huldy.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly a secret," replied Alice. "It's a business
matter. I have a great many things to be read over to
me, and considerable writing to do, and as Mr. Sawyer is
going away, I was obliged to have some one to help me."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Huldy, "you'll miss Mr. Sawyer when he
goes away; I did. Now you mustn't get jealous, Mr. Pettengill,"
she said to 'Zekiel; "you know Mr. Sawyer and I
were never in love with each other. That was all village
gossip, started by, you know who, and as for Mr. Sawyer
liking Lindy Putnam, or she liking him, I know better.
She's never got over the loss of her brother Jones, who, it
seems, wasn't her real brother, after all; and Samanthy
Green told me the other day that Lindy wanted to marry
him."</p>

<p>"I think matters are getting rather too personal for
me," said Uncle Ike, rising. "I may get drawn into it if I
stay any longer. I always liked Lindy Putnam myself."
And the old gentleman laughed heartily as he left the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you and me'd better be goin', if we want
to be home at dinner time," said 'Zekiel to Huldy. Then,
going to his sister, he took her in his arms and kissed her
on the cheek. "You know, Alice," said he, "that I ain't
much of a talker, but I shall never forget how good you've
been to me and Huldy, and if the old house burns down or
you get lonesome, you'll always find the latchstring out up
to the new house, an' there'll be a room, an' board, an'
good care for you as long as you want to stay. Eh,
Huldy?" said 'Zekiel, turning to his wife.</p>

<p>"You know, 'Zekiel," replied the impulsive Huldy, "I've
<a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a>said a dozen times that I wished Alice would come and live
with us. Won't you, Alice?" she added. "I never had a
sister, and I think it would be delightful to have one all to
myself, especially," she added archly, "when I have her
brother, too."</p>

<p>"I could never live in that house," said Alice, with a
slight shudder; "besides, I think my future path in life is
being marked out for me by the hand of Fate, which I am
powerless to resist. I am afraid that it will take me away
from you, my dear ones; but if it does, I shall always love
you both, and pray for your happiness and success."</p>

<p>At the front door 'Zekiel and Huldy met Quincy. The
latter had turned Miss Very over to the care of Mrs. Maxwell,
and had got one of the twins to carry the young lady's
trunk to her room, which was the one formerly occupied by
Mandy. He had then driven the carryall around to the
barn and was returning, anxious to bear his tidings of success
to Alice, when he met the departing couple.</p>

<p>"I hear you are going to leave us," said Huldy.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"Alice," replied Huldy; "and I told her she'd miss you
very much when you were gone."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," replied Quincy, "that any service that I
have rendered Miss Pettengill has not been of so important
a nature that it would be greatly missed. I am glad that I
have succeeded in securing her a companion and assistant
of her own sex, which will much more than compensate for
the loss of my feeble services."</p>

<p>"That's what I don't like about city folks," said Huldy
Pettengill, as she walked along the path, hanging on her
husband's arm.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked 'Zekiel bluntly.</p>

<p>"Because," continued Huldy, "they use such big words
to cover up their real feelings. Of course, he wouldn't let
on to us, but any one with half an eye could see that he's
<a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a>head over heels in love with your sister Alice, and he'd
stand on his head if she told him to."</p>

<p>"Well, Alice is too sensible a girl to ask him to do that
sort of thing," said 'Zekiel frankly. "Any way, I don't
believe she's in love with him."</p>

<p>"'Twould be a great match for her," said Huldy.</p>

<p>"I don't know 'bout that. On general principles, I don't
believe in country girls marryin' city fellers."</p>

<p>"I know you don't," said Huldy, and she gave his arm a
little squeeze.</p>

<p>"But," continued 'Zekiel, "Alice is different from most
country girls. Besides, she's lived in the city and knows
city ways. Anyway, I sha'n't interfere; I know Mr. Sawyer
is a respectable young man, and, by George! when he
wants to do anything, don't he jest put it through. The
way he sarcumvented that Strout was as good as a circus."</p>

<p>"I think I sarcumvented that Strout, too," said Huldy,
as they reached the corner of Deacon Mason's front fence.</p>

<p>"You've been quite a little flirt in your day," remarked
'Zekiel, "but it's all over now;" and he squeezed the little
hand that stole confidingly into his big, brawny one.</p>

<p>Quincy at once entered the parlor and found Alice seated
in her accustomed easy-chair.</p>

<p>"You have returned, Sir Knight," was the remark with
which Alice greeted him.</p>

<p>"I have, fair lady," replied Quincy, in the same vein; "I
have captured one of the enemy and brought her as a prisoner
to your castle. Here are some documents," he continued,
as he placed the proofs in Alice's hands, "that contain
valuable secrets, and they will, no doubt, furnish strong
evidence against the prisoner."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Alice, holding up the package.</p>

<p>"They are the proofs of three of your stories," replied
Quincy, relapsing into commonplace; "and Leopold says
they must be read and corrected at once. If we can attend
to this during the afternoon and evening, I will go up to<a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"></a>
Boston again to-morrow morning." Quincy then told
Alice about Rosa and the terms that he had made with her,
and Alice expressed herself as greatly pleased with the
arrangement. "You will find Miss Very a perfect lady,"
said Quincy, "with a low, melodious voice that will not jar
upon your ears, as mine, no doubt, has often done."</p>

<p>"You are unfair to yourself, when you say that," remarked
Alice earnestly. "Your voice has never jarred
upon my ears, and I have always been pleased to listen to
you."</p>

<p>Whether Quincy's voice would have grown softer and
sweeter and his words more impassioned if the interview
had continued, cannot be divined, for Mrs. Maxwell at that
moment opened the parlor door and called out, "Dinner's
ready," just as Mandy Skinner used to do in the days gone
by.</p>

<p>Miss Very was introduced to Alice and the others at the
dinner table, and took the seat formerly occupied by 'Zekiel.
Quincy consented to remain to dinner, as he knew his
services would be required in the proof reading. When
Cobb's twins reached the barn, after dinner, Jim said to
Bill, "Isn't she a stunner! I couldn't keep my eyes off'n
her."</p>

<p>"Neither could I," rejoined Bill. "I tell yer, Jim, style
comes nat'ral to city folks. I'll be durned if I know whether
I had chicken or codfish for dinner."</p>

<p>After the noonday meal the three zealous toilers in the
paths of literature began work. Quincy read from the manuscript,
Rosa held the proofs, while Alice listened intently,
and from time to time made changes in punctuation or
slight alterations in the language. No sentence had to be
rewritten, and when the reading of the story, Was It
Signed? was finished, Rosa said, "A remarkably clean set
of proofs; only a few changes, and those slight ones. In the
case of very few authors are their original ideas and second
<a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a>thoughts so harmonious. How do you manage it, Miss
Pettengill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," replied Alice, with a smile, "unless
it is that I keep my original ideas in my mind until they
reach the stage of second thoughts, and then I have them
written down."</p>

<p>"You will find Miss Pettengill very exact in dictation,"
said Quincy to Rosa. "I took that long story there down in
pencil, and I don't think I was obliged to change a dozen
words."</p>

<p>"To work with Miss Pettengill," remarked Rosa, "will be
more of a pleasure than a task."</p>

<p>This idea was re-echoed in Quincy's mind, and for a moment
he had a feeling of positive envy towards Miss Very.
Then he thought that hers was paid service, while his had
been a labor&mdash;of love. Yes, it might as well be put that
way.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk quite low in the west when the second
story, Her Native Land, was completed. "How dramatic!"
cried Rosa; "the endings of those chapters are as strong as
stage tableaus."</p>

<p>"It is being dramatized by Jameson of the 'Daily Universe,'"
said Quincy.</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted with Mr. Jameson," remarked
Rosa; "I belong to a social club of which he is the president.
He is a very talented young man and a great worker.
He once told me that when he began newspaper work he
wrote eighteen hours out of twenty-four for a month, and
nearly every night he woke up and made notes that he
wrote out in the morning. Do you believe in unconscious
mental cerebration, Mr. Sawyer?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," replied Quincy, laughing; "I never
had ideas enough to keep my brain busy all day, much less
supply it with work at night."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer is always unfair to himself," remarked Alice
to Miss Very. "As for myself, I will answer your question
<a name="Page_437" id="Page_437"></a>in the affirmative. I have often gone to bed with only the
general idea of a story in my mind, and have awakened
with the details all thought out and properly placed."</p>

<p>"I think it best to postpone the reading of the last story
until after supper," said Quincy.</p>

<p>Alice assented, and, turning to Rosa, asked, "Do you like
the country, Miss Very?"</p>

<p>"To speak honestly," replied Rosa, "I do not. I told Mr.
Sawyer so on the train. It is hotter in the country than it
is in the city. I can't bear the ticking of a clock in my
room, and I think crickets and owls are more nerve-destroying
than clocks, and I positively detest anything that buzzes
and stings, like bees, and wasps, and hornets."</p>

<p>"But don't you like cows, and sheep, and horses?" asked
Alice; "I love them."</p>

<p>"And I don't," said Rosa frankly. "I like beefsteak and
roast lamb, but I never saw a cow that didn't have a ferocious
glare in its eye when it looked at me." Both Quincy
and Alice laughed heartily. "As for horses," continued
Rosa, "I never drive alone. When I'm with some one I
alternate between hope and fear until I reach my destination."</p>

<p>"I trust you were more hopeful than fearful on your way
from Eastborough Centre," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh! I saw at a glance," remarked Rosa, "that you were
a skilful driver, and I trusted you implicitly."</p>

<p>"I have had to rely a great deal upon Mr. Sawyer," remarked
Alice, "and, like yourself, I have always placed the
greatest confidence in him. Huldy told me this morning,
Mr. Sawyer, that I would miss you very much, and I know
I shall."</p>

<p>"But you will have Miss Very with you constantly," said
Quincy.</p>

<p>"Oh! she does not like the country," continued Alice,
"and she will get homesick in a little while."</p>

<p>"One's likes and one's duties often conflict," said Rosa;
<a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a>and a grave look settled upon her face. "But how can you
write your book down here, Miss Pettengill? You will
have to consult hundreds of books, if you intend to write an
historical novel, as Mr. Sawyer told me you did. You ought
to have access to the big libraries in Boston, and, besides, in
the second-hand bookstores you can buy such treasures for
a mere song, if you will only spend the time to hunt for
them."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," broke in Quincy, "that my aunt,
Mrs. Chessman,&mdash;she is my mother's only sister, who lives
on Mt. Vernon Street,&mdash;wished me to extend a cordial invitation
to you two young ladies to visit her, while I am getting
your summer home ready for you. She suggests Nantucket
as the best place for work, but with every opportunity
for enjoyment, when work becomes a burden."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be delightful," cried Rosa. "I love the
sea, and there we shall have it all around us; and at night,
the great dome of Heaven, studded with stars, will reach
down to the sea on every side, and they say at 'Sconset, on
the east end of the island, that when the breakers come in
the sight is truly magnificent."</p>

<p>Quincy was inwardly amused at Rosa's enthusiasm, but
it served his purpose to encourage it, so he said, "I wish
Aunt Ella were her to join forces with Miss Very. You
would find it hard work to resist both of them, Miss Pettengill."</p>

<p>"You mean all three of you," said Alice, with a smile.</p>

<p>"If we go to Nantucket," added Rosa, "I shall have to
spend a week in the city, and perhaps more. I have no
dresses suitable for so long a residence at the beach."</p>

<p>"Neither have I," coincided Alice, with a laugh.</p>

<p>There the matter was dropped. Quincy knew too much,
to press the question to a decision that evening. He had
learned by experience that Alice never said yes or no until
her mind was made up, and he knew that the answer was
more likely to be favorable if he gave her plenty of time
<a name="Page_439" id="Page_439"></a>for reflection; besides, he thought that Alice might wish to
know more particularly what his aunt said, for she would
be likely to consider that his aunt must have some reason
for giving such an invitation to two persons who were virtually
strangers to her.</p>

<p>After supper, the third story, How He Lost Both Name
and Fortune, was read and corrected, and it was the unusually
late hour of eleven o'clock before the lights in the
Pettengill house were extinguished. It was past midnight
when Quincy sought his room at Mrs. Hawkins's boarding
house, and the picture of Alice Pettengill, that he had purloined
so long ago, stood on a little table at the head of his
bed, leaning against a large family Bible, which he found
in the room.</p>

<p>The next morning he was up early, and visited the grocery
store. Mr. Strout and Hiram both assured him that
business had picked up amazingly, and was really "splendid."
The new wagons were building up trade very fast.
Billy Ricker went over to Montrose for orders Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday mornings, and delivered them in
the afternoons. This gave Abbott Smith a chance to post
up the books on those days, for he had been made bookkeeper.
He went to Eastborough Centre and Westvale,
the new name given to West Eastborough at the last town
meeting, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings. He
delivered goods on the afternoons of those days, which
gave him an opportunity to spend Sunday at home with his
father and his family.</p>

<p>When Quincy reached the Pettengill house, Mrs. Maxwell
informed him that Miss Pettengill was in the parlor
alone. After greeting Alice, Quincy asked, "But where is
Miss Very?"</p>

<p>"I told her I should not need her services until after I
had seen you," she replied. "I have a question to ask you
Mr. Sawyer, and I know you will give me a truthful answer.<a name="Page_440" id="Page_440"></a>
What led your aunt to invite me to come and visit
her?"</p>

<p>Quincy knew that Alice had been considering the matter,
and this one simple question, to which she expected a
truthful answer, was the crucial test.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate in replying. If he did, he knew the
result would be fatal to his hopes.</p>

<p>"Only the promptings of her own good nature. She is
one of the warmest-hearted women in the world," continued
Quincy. "I will tell you just how it happened. I told
her I had found an assistant to help you in your work, and
that the next thing was to fix upon a place for a summer
residence. I asked her opinion, and after considering the
advantages and disadvantages of a score of places, she
finally settled upon Nantucket as being the most desirable.
Then she said, 'While you are finding a place and getting it
ready for them, ask Miss Pettengill to come and visit me
and bring her friend. Tell her that I am rich, as far as
money goes, but poor in love and companionship. Tell
them both that I shall love to have them come and will do
everything I can to make their visit a pleasant one.' Those
were her words as nearly as I can remember them;" and
Quincy waited silently for the decision.</p>

<p>It soon came. Alice went to him and extended her hand,
which Quincy took.</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Alice in her quiet way, "that I thank
her very much and that we will come."</p>

<p>"How soon?" inquired Quincy anxiously and rather abruptly.</p>

<p>"In a few days," replied Alice. "I can get ready much
sooner with Miss Very to help me."</p>

<p>She withdrew the hand, which she had unconsciously
allowed to remain in his so long, and a slight flush mounted
to her cheek, for Quincy had equally unconsciously given
it a gentle pressure as he relinquished it.</p>

<p>"I must do up these proofs," said he, going to the table.<a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a>
"I will get the next train to Boston. I will be back to-morrow
noon, and in the afternoon I will drive over to
Montrose about that deed of the Putnam house. I know
Aunt Ella will be delighted to hear that you are coming."
But he said nothing about his own delight at being the
bearer of the tidings.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Alice sat in her chair as she had
many a time before and thought. As she sat there she realized
more strongly than she had ever done that if Fate was
marking out her course for her, it had certainly chosen as
its chief instrument the masterful young man who had just
left her.</p>

<p>The remainder of that day and the morning of the next
Alice spent in dictating to Rosa a crude general outline of
Blennerhassett. During the work she was obliged, naturally,
to address Rosa many times, and uniformly called
her Miss Very. Finally Rosa said, "Wouldn't you just as
soon call me Rosa? Miss Very seems so stiff and formal."</p>

<p>"I hope you will not consider me uncompanionable or
set in my ways," remarked Alice. "We are working, you
know, and not playing," she continued with a sweet smile.
"I have no doubt you are worthy of both my esteem and
love, but I have known you less than a day and such things
come slowly with me. Let me call you Miss Very, because
you are that to me now. When the time comes, as I feel it
will, to call you Rosa, it shall come from a full heart.
When I call you Rosa, it will be because I love you, and,
after that, nothing will ever change my feelings towards
you."</p>

<p>"I understand you," replied Rosa. "I will work and
wait."</p>

<p>Quincy arrived at about the same time of day that he
did when he came with Rosa. Miss Very had gone to her
room, so that he saw Alice alone. He told her that his aunt
was greatly pleased at her acceptance and would be ready
to receive her at any time that it was convenient for her to
<a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a>come. He proffered his services to aid her in getting ready
for the journey, but she told him that with Miss Very's help
she would need no other assistance.</p>

<p>"I have another matter of business to speak about," continued
she, "and if you will kindly attend to that, when you
go to Montrose, it will oblige me very much. You are always
doing something to make me your debtor," she added
with a smile.</p>

<p>"I would do more if you would allow me," replied
Quincy.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said Alice, "'Zekiel does not wish to borrow
any money, nor would he accept the gift of the Putnam
homestead unless he, in turn, deeded this house and
farm to me. He is going to run this farm and pay me what
he gets from the sale of products. If you will have Squire
Rundlett draw up both deeds and the agreement, the whole
matter can be fixed before I go away."</p>

<p>Quincy promised to give his attention to the matter that
afternoon. He drove up to his boarding house and hitched
his horse at the front door. Mrs. Hawkins saw him enter
and take his seat at the dinner table. "There's that Mr.
Sawyer; he's slept in this house just one night and eaten
just one meal up to this noon for nigh on a week. Them
city folks must have Injun rubber stummicks and cast iron
backs or they couldn't eat in so many different places and
sleep in so many different beds. Why, if I go away and
stay over night, when I git home I'm allus sicker'n a horse
and tired enough to drop."</p>

<p>Quincy went to Montrose that afternoon and saw Squire
Rundlett. The latter promised to make the papers out the
next day, and said he would bring them over for signing
the following morning. Quincy drove down to Deacon
Mason's and told 'Zekiel when to be on hand, and after
leaving the team in the Pettengill barn, saw Alice and informed
her of the Squire's proposed visit. He told her
<a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a>that he would come down that morning to act as a witness,
if his services were required.</p>

<p>He spent the next day at the grocery store, going over
the stock with Strout and Abbott Smith, and had a list
made of articles that they thought it would be advisable to
carry in the future. He told Strout that he would visit
some wholesale grocery houses in Boston and have samples
sent down.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sawyer is improvin'," said Mrs. Hawkins to Betsy
the next morning after breakfast. "He's slept in his bed
two nights runnin', and he's eat four square meals, and
seemed to enjoy them, too. I guess he didn't git much
when he was jumpin' 'round so from one place to another."</p>

<p>Squire Rundlett kept his word, and the legal documents
were duly signed and executed. Alice told the Squire that
she was going away for several months, and that she would
undoubtedly send to him from time to time.</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Pettengill," replied the gallant Squire,
"you shall have all you ask for if I have to sell my best
horse and mortgage my house. But I don't think it will
be necessary," he added. "Some more dividends and interest
have come in and I have more than a thousand dollars
to your credit now."</p>

<p>After the Squire had left, Alice told Quincy that her
preparations were all made, and that she would be ready
to go to Boston the next day. The mid-day train was fixed
upon. After dinner that day, Quincy informed Mrs. Hawkins
that he wished to pay his bill in full, as he should
leave for good the next day.</p>

<p>Holding the money in her hand, Mrs. Hawkins entered
the kitchen and addressed Betsy.</p>

<p>"Just what I expected," said she; "jest as that Mr. Sawyer
got to stayin' home nights and eating his meals like a
Christian, he ups an' gits. I guess it'll be a dry summer.
I kinder thought them two boys over to the grocery would
come here, but I understand they're goin' down to Pettengill's,
<a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a>and somebody told me that Strout goes over to Eastborough
Centre every Sunday now. I s'pose he's tryin'
to shine up again to that Bessie Chisholm, that he used to
be sweet on. When he goes to keepin' house there'll be
another boarder gone;" and the poor woman, having borrowed
enough trouble, sat down and wiped a supposed tear
out of each eye with her greasy apron.</p>

<p>Quincy reached Aunt Ella's residence with the young
ladies about noon. Aunt Ella gave the three travellers a
hearty welcome, and the young ladies were shown at once
to their rooms, which were on the third floor at the front of
the house. They were connected, so that Rosa could be
close at hand in case Alice should need assistance.</p>

<p>While the footman and Buttons were taking the trunks
upstairs, Quincy asked his aunt if he could leave his trunk
there for a short time. "I do not wish to take it home,"
he said, "until after I have the ladies settled at Nantucket.
The carriage is waiting outside and I am going to get the
one o'clock train."</p>

<p>"I will take good care of your trunk," said Aunt Ella,
"and you, too, if you will come and live with me. But
can't you stop to lunch with us?" she asked. But Quincy
declined, and requesting his aunt to say good-by to the
young ladies for him, he entered the carriage and was
driven off.</p>

<p>After luncheon, which was served in the dining-room,
General Chessman and Aides-de-Camp Pettengill and Very
held a counsel of war in the General's private tent. It was
decided that the mornings should be devoted, for a while,
at least, to shopping and visiting modistes and milliners.
Miss Very was also to give some of her time to visits to the
libraries and the second-hand bookstores looking for books
that would be of value to Alice in her work. The afternoons
were to be passed in conversation and in listening to Miss
Very's reading from the books that she had purchased or
taken from the libraries. The evenings were to be filled up
<a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a>with music, and the first one disclosed the pleasing fact
that Miss Very had a rich, full contralto voice that had
been well cultivated and that she could play Beethoven or
the songs of the day with equal facility.</p>

<p>While the feminine trio were thus enjoying themselves
in Boston with an admixture of work and play, Quincy was
busily engaged at Nantucket in building a nest for them,
as he called it.</p>

<p>He had found a large, old-fashioned house on the bluff
at the north shore, overlooking the harbor, owned by Mrs.
Gibson. She was a widow with two children, one a boy of
about nineteen, named Thomas, and the other a girl of
twelve, named Dorothy, but generally designated as
Tommy and Dolly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gibson consented to let her second floor for a period
of four months, and to supply them with meals. The price
was fixed upon, and Quincy knew he had been unusually
lucky in securing so desirable a location at such a reasonable
price.</p>

<p>There were three rooms, one a large front room, with a
view of the harbor, and back of it two sleeping rooms, looking
out upon a large garden at the rear of the house.
Quincy mentally surveyed the large room and marked the
places with a piece of chalk upon the carpet where the
piano and the bookcase were to go. Then he decided that
the room needed a lounge and a desk with all necessary
fixtures and stationery for Rosa to work at. There were
some stiff-backed chairs in the room, but he concluded that
a low easy-chair, like the one Alice had at home, and a
couple of wicker rocking chairs, which would be cool and
comfortable during the hot summer days, were absolutely
essential.</p>

<p>He then returned to Boston, hired an upright piano and
purchased the other articles, including a comfortable office-chair
to go with the desk. He was so afraid that he would
forget some article of stationery that he made a list and
<a name="Page_446" id="Page_446"></a>checked it off. But this did not satisfy him. He spent a
whole morning in different stationery stores looking over
their stocks to make sure that he had omitted nothing.
The goods were packed and shipped by express to Mrs.
Thomas Gibson, Nantucket, Mass. Then, and not till then,
did Quincy seek his aunt's residence with the intelligence
that the nest was builded and ready for the birds. When
he informed the ladies that everything was ready for their
reception at their summer home, Aunt Ella said that their
departure would have to be delayed for a few days, as the
delinquent dressmakers had failed to deliver certain articles
of wearing apparel. This argument was, of course,
unanswerable, and Quincy devoted the time to visiting the
wholesale grocers, as he had promised Strout that he would
do, and to buying and shipping a long list of books that
Miss Very informed him Miss Pettengill needed for her
work. He learned that during his absence the proofs of
The Man Without a Tongue had been brought over by Mr.
Ernst and read and corrected, Aunt Ella taking Quincy's
place as reader.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, and on the tenth of May a party of
three ladies and one gentleman was driven to the station in
time for the one o'clock train. They had lunched early
and the whole party was healthy, happy, and in the best of
spirits. Then came the leave-takings. The two young ladies
and the gentleman sped away upon the train, while the
middle-aged lady started for home in her carriage, telling
herself a dozen times on the way that she knew she would
be lonesomer than ever when she got there.</p>

<p>The trip by train and boat was uneventful. Alice sat
quietly and enjoyed the salt sea breeze, while both Quincy
and Rosa entertained her with descriptions of the bits of
land and various kinds of sailing craft that came in sight.
It was nearly seven o'clock when the steamer rounded
Brant Point. In a short time it was moored to the wharf,
and the party, with their baggage, were conveyed swiftly
<a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a>to Mrs. Gibson's, that lady having been notified by Quincy
to expect them at any moment. He did not enter the
house. He told Miss Very to address him care of his aunt
if they needed anything, and that Mr. Ernst and himself
would come down when Miss Pettengill had completed two
or three chapters of her book. Quincy then bade them
good-by and was driven to a modest hotel close to the
steamboat wharf. He took the morning boat to Boston,
and that afternoon informed Aunt Ella of the safe arrival
of his fair charges.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?" asked Aunt Ella.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find my father," replied Quincy, "and
through him secure introductions to the other members of
my family."</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Aunt Ella; "if they don't treat you well
come and stay with me and we will go to Old Orchard together
about the first of June. I never skip out the last of
April, because I always enjoy having a talk with the assessor
when he comes around in May."</p>

<p>When Rosa took her seat at the new desk next morning,
she exclaimed with delight, "What a nice husband Mr.
Sawyer would make!"</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" inquired Alice gravely.</p>

<p>"Because he'd be such a good hand to go shopping,"
Rosa answered. "I've been all over this desk twice and I
don't believe he has forgotten a single thing that we are
likely to need."</p>

<p>"Good work requires good tools," remarked Alice.</p>

<p>"And a good workman," interposed Rosa.</p>

<p>"Then we have every adjunct for success," said Alice,
"and we will commence just where we left off at Mrs.
Chessman's."</p>

<p>The work on the book progressed famously. Alice was
in fine mental condition and Rosa seemingly took as much
interest in its progress as did her employer. In three
weeks the three opening chapters had been written. "I
<a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"></a>wonder what Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Ernst will think of that?"
said Alice, as Rosa wrote the last line of the third chapter.</p>

<p>"I am going to write to Mr. Sawyer to-day. We must
have those books before we can go much farther. Would
it not be well to tell him that we are ready for our audience?"</p>

<p>Alice assented, and the letter reached Quincy one Friday
evening, it being his last call on his aunt before her
departure for Old Orchard. "Give my love to both of
them," said Aunt Ella, "and tell Alice I send her a kiss. I
won't tell you how to deliver it; you will probably find some
way before you come back."</p>

<p>Quincy protested that he could not undertake to deliver
it, but his aunt only laughed, kissed him, bade him good-by,
and told him to be sure and come down to Maine to see
her.</p>

<p>Quincy and Leopold took the Saturday afternoon boat
and arrived, as usual, about seven o'clock. They both repaired
to the hotel previously patronized by Quincy, having
decided to defer their call upon the young ladies until
Sunday morning. It was a bright, beautiful day, not a
cloud was to be seen in the broad, blue expanse above them.
A cool breeze was blowing steadily from the southwest,
and as the young men walked down Centre Street towards
the Cliff, Leopold remarked that he did not wonder that the
Nantucketers loved their "tight little isle" and were sorry
to leave it. "One seems to be nearer Heaven here than he
does in a crowded city, don't he, Quincy?" Quincy thought
to himself that his Heaven was in Nantucket, and that he
was very near to it, but he did not choose to utter these
feelings to his friend, so he merely remarked that the sky
did seem much nearer.</p>

<p>They soon reached Mrs. Gibson's and were shown directly
to the young ladies' parlor and library, for it answered
both purposes. They were attired in two creations
of Mrs. Chessman's dressmaker, Aunt Ella having selected
<a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"></a>the materials and designed the costumes, for which art
she had a great talent. Rosa's dress was of a dark rose tint,
with revers and a V-shaped neck, filled in with tulle of a
dark green hue. The only other trimming on the dress was
a green silk cord that bordered the edges of the revers and
the bottom of the waist. As Quincy looked at her, for she
sat nearest to the door, she reminded him of a beautiful
red rose, and the green leaves which enhanced its beauty.
Then his eyes turned quickly to Alice, who sat in her easy-chair,
near the window. Her dress was of light blue, with
square-cut neck, filled in with creamy white lace. In her
hair nestled a flower, light pink in color, and as Quincy
looked at her he thought of the little blue flower called
forget-me-not, and recalled the fact that wandering one
day in the country, during his last year at college, he had
come upon a little brook, both sides of which, for hundreds
of feet, were lined with masses of this modest little flower.
Ah! but this one forget-me-not was more to him than all
the world beside.</p>

<p>The greetings were soon over, and Quincy was assured
by both young ladies that they were happy and contented,
and that every requisite for their comfort had been supplied
by Mrs. Gibson.</p>

<p>The reading then began. Rosa possessed a full, flexible,
dramatic voice, and the strong passages were delivered with
great fervor, while the sad or sentimental ones were tinged
with a tone of deep pathos.</p>

<p>At the conclusion Alice said, "I wish Miss Very could
read my book to the publishers."</p>

<p>"You forget," remarked Leopold, with a laugh, "that
reading it to me will probably amount to the same thing."</p>

<p>A merry party gathered about Mrs. Gibson's table at
dinner, after which they went for a drive through the
streets of the quaint old town. Quincy had, as the phrenologists
say, a great bump for locality. Besides, he had
studied a map of the town while coming down, and, as he
<a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a>remarked, they couldn't get lost for any great length of
time, as Nantucket was an island, and the water supplied
a natural boundary to prevent their getting too far out of
their way.</p>

<p>While Dolly Gibson was helping her mother by wiping
the dinner dishes, she said, with that air of judicial conviction
that is shown by some children, that she guessed that
the lady in the red dress was Mr. Leopold's girl, and that
the blind lady in the blue dress was Mr. Quincy's.</p>

<p>After a light supper they again gathered in the parlor
and an hour was devoted to music. Leopold neither played
nor sang, but he was an attentive and critical listener. It
was a beautiful moonlight night, and Leopold asked Rosa
if she would not like to take a walk up on the Cliff. She
readily consented, but Alice pleasantly declined Quincy's
invitation to accompany them, and for the first time since
the old days at Mason's Corner, he and she were alone together.</p>

<p>They talked of Eastborough and Mason's Corner and
Aunt Ella for a while. Then conversation lagged and they
sat for a time in a satisfied, peaceful silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly Quincy spoke. "I had almost forgotten, Miss
Pettengill, I bought a new song yesterday morning, and I
brought it with me. If you have no objection I will try,
it over."</p>

<p>"I always enjoy your singing," she replied.</p>

<p>He ran down stairs and soon returned with the music.
He seated himself at the piano and played the piece through
with great expression.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful melody," remarked Alice. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"It is a German song," replied Quincy, "by Reichardt.
It is called 'Love's Request.' I will sing it this time."</p>

<p>And he did sing it with all the force and fervor of a
noble, manly nature, speaking out his love covertly in the
words of another, but hoping in his heart that the beautiful
<a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"></a>girl who listened to him would forget the author and
think only of the singer. How many times young lovers
have tried this artful trick, and in what proportion it has
been successful only Heaven knows.</p>

<p>"The words are very pretty, are they not?" said Alice.
"I was listening so closely to the melody that I did not
catch them all."</p>

<p>"I will read them to you," rejoined Quincy, and going
to the window, where the light was still bright enough, he
read the words of the song in a low, impassioned voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now the day is slowly waning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Evening breezes softly, softly moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou ne'er heed my complaining,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Canst thou leave me thus alone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay with me, my darling, stay!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, like a dream, thy life shall pass away,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And thine eyes begin to weep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stay with me, my darling, stay!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, like a dream, thy life shall pass away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like a dream shall pass away.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a>As Quincy finished reading, Leopold and Rosa came suddenly
into the room.</p>

<p>"We were not eavesdropping," explained Leopold, "but
just as we were going to enter the room we heard your
voice and knew that you were either reading or speaking a
piece, so we waited until you had finished."</p>

<p>"I was only reading the words of a new song that I
brought down to Miss Pettengill," said Quincy; "she liked
the melody and I thought she would appreciate it still more
if she knew the words."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Leopold; "that's the reason I don't like
opera, I mean the singing part. All that I can ever make
out sounds like oh! ah! ow! and when I try to read the
book in English and listen to the singers at the same time I
am lost in a hopeless maze."</p>

<p>The young gentlemen were soon on their way to their
hotel, and the next afternoon found them again in Boston.</p>

<p>The month of June was a busy, but very enjoyable one,
for both Alice and Rosa. They were up early in the morning
and were at work before breakfast. They ate heartily
and slept soundly. Every pleasant afternoon, when tea was
over, they went riding. Tommy Gibson held the reins,
and although Dolly was not yet in her teens, she knew
every nook and corner, and object of interest on the island,
and she took a child's delight in pointing them out, and
telling the stories that she had heard about them. The
books that Quincy brought on his last visit were utilized,
and Miss Very made up another list to be sent to him before
his next visit.</p>

<p>The proofs of three more stories Mr. Ernst sent down
by mail, and after correction, they were returned to him
in a similar manner. Little Dolly Gibson was impressed
into service as a reader, for Rosa could not read and correct
at the same time, and there was no obliging Mr. Sawyer
near at hand. As Huldy had said, Alice did miss him. It
must be said, in all truthfulness, not so much for himself,
<a name="Page_453" id="Page_453"></a>but for the services he had rendered. As yet, Alice's heart
was untouched.</p>

<p>When Dolly Gibson showed her mother the money that
Miss Very had given her, at Alice's direction, she was told
to take it right back at once, but Dolly protested that she
had earned it, and when her mother asked her to tell how,
the child, whose memory was phenomenal, sat down and
made her mother's hair stand almost on end and her blood
almost run cold with her recitals of the Eight of Spades,
The Exit of Mrs. Delmonnay, and He Thought He Was
Dead.</p>

<p>"They are immense," cried Dolly, "they beat all the
fairy stories I ever read!"</p>

<p>In due time another letter was sent to Mr. Sawyer, informing
him that more books were needed, and that more
chapters were ready, and on the morning of the last Sunday
in June the young ladies were awaiting the arrival of
Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Ernst.</p>

<p>The morning had opened with a heavy shower and the
sky was still overcast with angry-looking, threatening rain
clouds. Within the little parlor all was bright and cheerful.</p>

<p>Familiar voices were heard greeting Mrs. Gibson
and the children, and men's footsteps soon sounded upon
the stairs. Leopold entered first, and, advancing to Rosa,
handed her a large bouquet of beautiful red roses.</p>

<p>"Sweets to the sweet, roses to Miss Rosa," said he, as he
bowed and presented them.</p>

<p>"They are beautiful," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"All roses are considered so," he remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>While this little byplay was going on, Quincy had approached
Alice, who, as usual, was sitting by the window,
and placed in her hand a small bunch of flowers. As he
did so he said in a low voice, "They are forget-me-nots.
There is a German song about them, of which I remember
a little," and he hummed a few measures.</p><p><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454"></a></p>

<p>"Oh! thank you," cried Alice, as she held the flowers
before her eyes in a vain effort to see them. "The music
is pretty. Can't you remember any of the words?"</p>

<p>"Only a few," replied Quincy. Then he repeated in a
low, but clear voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is the sweet flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;They call forget-me-not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;That flower place on thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;And think of me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Say, Quincy, can't you come over here and recite a little
poem about roses to Miss Very, just to help me out?"
cried Leopold. "All I can think of is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The rose is red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;The violet's blue&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Stop where you are," said Rosa laughingly, "for that
will do."</p>

<p>Alice dropped the forget-me-nots, in her lap. The illusion
was dispelled.</p>

<p>The newly-completed chapters were next read, and quite
a spirited discussion took place in regard to the political
features introduced in one of them. Dinner intervened
and then the discussion was resumed.</p>

<p>Alice maintained that to write about Aaron Burr and
omit politics would be the play of "Hamlet," with Hamlet
left out; and her auditors were charmed and yet somewhat
startled at the impassioned and eloquent manner in
which she defended Burr's political principles.</p>

<p>When she finished Leopold said, "Miss Pettengill, if you
will put in your book the energetic defence that you have
just made, I will withdraw my objections."</p>

<p>"You will find that and more in the next chapter," Alice
replied.</p><p><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a></p>

<p>And the reading was resumed.</p>

<p>The angry, threatening clouds had massed themselves
once more; the thunder roared; the lightning flashed and
the rain fell in torrents.</p>

<p>Leopold walked to the window and looked out. "Walking
is out of the question," said he; "will you come for a
sail?"</p>

<p>Music filled the evening, and during a lull in the storm
the young men reached their lodgings.</p>

<p>Another month had nearly passed. The weather was
much warmer, but there was a great incentive to hard work&mdash;the
book was nearly finished. Quincy had sent down a
package of books soon after his return home, and Alice and
Rosa had worked even harder than in June.</p>

<p>Another letter went from Miss Very to Mr. Sawyer. It
contained but a few words: "The book is done. Miss Pettengill
herself wrote the words, 'The end,' on the last
page, signed her name, and dated it 'July 30, 186&mdash;.' She
awaits your verdict."</p>

<p>The first Sunday in August found the young ladies
again expectant. Once more they sat on a Sunday morning
awaiting the advent of their gentlemen friends. The
day was pleasant, but warm. Soon a voice was heard at
the front door. Both ladies listened intently; but one person,
evidently, was coming upstairs. Alice thought it
must be Mr. Sawyer, while Rosa said to herself, "I think it
must be Mr. Ernst."</p>

<p>A light knock, the door was opened and Quincy entered.</p>

<p>Rosa looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ernst," said Quincy, "wished me to present his
regrets at not being able to accompany me. The fact is he
will be very busy this coming week. He is going to try
to close up his work, so that he can come down next Saturday.
He intends to take a month's vacation. I shall
come with him, and we will endeavor to have a fitting celebration
of the completion of your book, Miss Pettengill.<a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a>
You young ladies look very cool and comfortable this hot
day."</p>

<p>They were both dressed in white, Alice with a sash of
blue, while Rosa wore one of pink.</p>

<p>"Then we shall have no reading till next Sunday," remarked
Rosa.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, seating himself in one of the willow
rockers; "we have decided upon the following programme,
if it meets with Miss Pettengill's approval. I am to listen
to the remainder of the book to-day. I will hand the complete
manuscript over to him to-morrow afternoon. He
will then finish the chapters that he has not read and turn
the work over to his firm, with his approval, before he
comes down for his rest. If the work is accepted, Mr.
Morton, one of the firm, will write him to that effect."</p>

<p>"The plan is certainly satisfactory to me," said Alice,
"and Miss Very and I will be delighted to contribute our
aid to the proposed celebration."</p>

<p>Rosa then resumed her reading. But dinner time came
before it was completed. At that meal they were all introduced
to Captain Henry Marble.</p>

<p>"My only brother," Mrs. Gibson said, by way of introduction.
"He's just home from a cruise. His ship is at New
Bedford. He is going to take the children out late this
afternoon for a sail in the harbor. He always does when
he comes here. Wouldn't you ladies and Mr. Sawyer like
to go with him?"</p>

<p>Captain Marble repeated the invitation, adding that he
was an old sailor, that he had a large sailboat, and that they
were "only going to Wauwinet, not out to sea, you know,
but only up the inner harbor, which is just like a pond, you
know."</p>


<p>Rosa thought it would be delightful, but such a trip had
no attractions for Alice, and it was finally decided that Rosa
should go, while Alice and Mr. Sawyer would remain at
home.</p><p><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"></a></p>

<p>The reading of the remaining chapters of Blennerhassett
was completed by three o'clock, and at quarter of four,
Miss Very, attired in a natty yachting costume, which
formed part of her summer outfit, was ready to accompany
Captain Marble and the children on their trip.</p>

<p>When they were alone Quincy turned to Alice and said,
"I bought another song yesterday morning, which I
thought you might like to hear."</p>

<p>"Is it another German song?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"No," replied Quincy, as he took a roll from the piano
and opened it. "It is a duet; the music is by Bosco, but
you can tell nothing by that. The composer's real name
may be Jones or Smith."</p>

<p>He seated himself at the piano and played it through, as
he had done with that other song two long months before.</p>

<p>"I think it more beautiful than the other," said Alice.
"Are the words as sweet as those in that other song?"</p>

<p>"Then you have not forgotten the other one," said
Quincy, earnestly.</p>

<p>"How could I forget it?" answered Alice. "Rosa has
sung it to me several times, but it did not sound to me as
it did when you sang it."</p>

<p>"I will sing this one to you," said he; and Alice came and
stood by his side at the piano.</p>

<p>Quincy felt that the time to which he had looked forward
so long had come at last. He could restrain the
promptings of his heart no longer. He loved this woman,
and she must know it; even if she rejected that love, he
must tell her.</p>

<p>"It is called 'The Bird of Love,'" he said. Then he
played the prelude to the song. He sang as he had never
sung before; all the power and pathos and love that in him
lay were breathed forth in the words and music of that song.</p>

<p>With his voice lingering upon the last word, he turned
and looked up at Alice. Upon her face there was a startled,
almost frightened look.</p><p><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a></p>

<p>"Shall I read the words to you, Miss Pettengill?"
There was almost a command in the way he said it. His
love had o'ermastered his politeness.</p>

<p>Alice said nothing, but bowed her head.</p>

<p>Then Quincy recited the words of the song. He had no
need to read them, for he knew them by heart. It seemed
to him that he had written the words himself. He did not
even remember the author's name, and Alice stood with
bowed head and closed eyes and drank in these words as
they fell from his lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In this heart of mine the bird of love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has built a nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has built a nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so she has in mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Response:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so she has in mine!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And she toils both day and night, no thought<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of food or rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of food or rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sings this song divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Response:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sings this song divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duet:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All the day long,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such a sweet song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Teaching love true,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I love! Do you?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Quincy came to the last line, instead of reading it
he turned to the piano and sang it with even more passion
in his voice than at first.</p>

<p>"Will you try it over with me?" he said. And without
waiting for her reply he dashed off the prelude.</p>

<p>Their voices rang out together until they reached the
line, "And so she has in mine." As Alice sang these words
she opened her eyes and looked upward. A smile of supreme
<a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"></a>joy spread over and irradiated her face. Her voice
faltered; she stopped, then she caught at the piano with her
right hand. She tottered and would have fallen if Quincy
had not sprung up and taken her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Alice?" cried he; "is it so? Can you truly
say, 'And so she has in mine?'"</p>

<p>And Alice looked up at him with that glorious smile still
upon her face and softly whispered, "'And so she has in
mine,' Quincy."</p>

<p>Quincy led her to the lounge by the window, through
which the cool evening breeze was blowing, and they sat
down side by side. It has been truly said that the conversations
of lovers are more appreciated by themselves than
by anybody else, and it is equally true that at the most tender
moment, in such conversations, intensely disagreeable
interruptions are likely to occur.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is the well-meaning but unthinking father;
again it is the solicitous but inquisitive mother; but more
often it is the unregenerate and disrespectful young brother
or sister. In this case it was Miss Rosa Very, who burst
into the room, bright and rosy, after her trip upon the
water. As she entered she cried out, "Oh! you don't know
what you missed. I had a most delightful&mdash;" She stopped
short, the truth flashed upon her that there were other delightful
ways of passing the time than in a sailboat. She
was in a dilemma.</p>

<p>Quincy solved the problem. He simply said, "Good-by,
Alice, for one short week."</p>

<p>He turned, expecting to see Miss Very, but she had vanished.
He clasped Alice in his arms, and kissed her, for
the first time, then he led her to her easy-chair and left
her there.</p>

<p>As he quitted the room and closed the door he met Miss
Rosa Very in the entry.</p>

<p>"I did not know," said she, "but I am so glad to know it.
She is the sweetest, purest, loveliest woman I have ever
<a name="Page_460" id="Page_460"></a>known, and your love is what she needed to complete her
happiness. She will be a saint now. I will take good care
of her, Mr. Sawyer, until you come again, for I love her,
too."</p>

<p>Quincy pressed her hand warmly, and the next moment
was in the little street. He was a rich man, as the world
judges riches, but to him his greatest treasure was Alice's
first kiss, still warm upon his lips.</p><p><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a></p>

<h3>THEN THEY WERE MARRIED.<br /></h3>

<p>When he bade Alice good-by for a week, Quincy was
keeping a promise he had made to his father. The
second evening before he had spent with his family at
Nahant, and while he was smoking an after-dinner cigar
upon the veranda, the Hon. Nathaniel had joined him.</p>

<p>"Quincy," said the latter, "I must ask you when you
intend to resume your professional duties. You are now
restored to health, and it is my desire that you do so at
once."</p>

<p>"While I would not wilfully show disrespect to your
wishes, father," said Quincy, calmly, "I must say frankly
that I do not care to go back to the office. The study of
law is repugnant to me, and its practice would be a daily
martyrdom."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the Hon. Nathaniel, starting in his chair.
"Perhaps, sir, you have fixed upon a calling that is more
elevated and ennobling than the law."</p>

<p>"One more congenial, at any rate," remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Then you have chosen a profession," said his father
with some eagerness. "May I inquire what it is?"</p>

<p>"It can hardly be called a profession," he answered.
"I've bought a third interest in a country grocery store."</p>

<p>If the Hon. Nathaniel started before, this last piece of information
fairly brought him to his feet. "And may I inquire,
sir," he thundered, "if this special partnership in a
country grocery store is the summit of your ambitions?
I suppose I shall hear next that you are engaged to some
farmer's daughter, and propose to marry her, regardless
<a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"></a>of the wishes of your family, and despite the terrible example
supplied by your Uncle James."</p>

<p>"It hasn't come to that yet," remarked Quincy, calmly,
"but it may if I find a farmer's daughter who comes up to
my ideal of a wife and to whom I can give an honest love."</p>

<p>The Hon. Nathaniel sank back in his chair. Quincy
continued, "I will not try to answer your sarcastic reference
to the grocery store. It is a good investment and an
honorable business, fully as honorable as cheating the
prison or the gallows of what is due them; but the summit
of my ambition is by no means reached. I am young yet
and have plenty of time to study the ground before expanding
my career, but I will tell you, privately and confidentially,
that my friends have asked me to run for the
General Court, and I have about decided to stand as a candidate
for nomination as representative from our district."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say that, Quincy," said his father,
somewhat mollified, and he edged his arm-chair a little
closer to his son, despite the heavy clouds of smoke emitted
from Quincy's cigar. "If you get the regular nomination
in our district it's tantamount to an election. I need
scarcely say that whatever influence I may possess will be
exerted in your favor."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Quincy; "I mean to stump the district,
anyway. If I lose the regular nomination I shall take
an independent one. I had rather fight my way in than be
pushed in."</p>

<p>His father smiled and patted him on the arm. Then they
rose from their chairs, Quincy observing that as he was
going away early in the morning he would immediately
retire.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said his father. "I have a favor to
ask of you, Quincy. It is this, Lord Algernon Hastings,
heir to the earldom of Sussex, and his sister, Lady Elfrida,
are now in Boston, and bring letters from the Lord High
Chancellor, with whom I became acquainted when I was
<a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a>in England, two years ago. I have invited them to visit us
here next week, and my wish is that you will spend as
much of your time at home as possible and assist me in
entertaining them&mdash;I mean the son, of course, particularly."</p>

<p>Quincy's thoughts flew quickly to Nantucket and back.
Had he foreseen what was to happen on his coming visit,
he would have hesitated still longer, but thinking that,
after all, next Sunday's journey might not end any more
conclusively than the previous one, he presently turned to
his father and answered:</p>

<p>"I will do so. I must go to-morrow, but I will return
early on Monday, and will stay at home the entire week."</p>

<p>"I thank you very much, Quincy," said the Hon. Nathaniel,
and he laid his hand on his son's shoulder as affectionately
as he was capable of doing, when they entered the
house.</p>

<p>Lady Elfrida Hastings and her brother, Lord Algernon,
arrived in due season, and Quincy was there to assist at
their reception. The former was tall, and dark, and stately;
her features were cast in a classic mould, but the look in
her eye was cold and distant, and the face, though having
all the requirements of beauty, yet lacked it. To Mrs.
Sawyer and her daughter, Florence, the Lady Elfrida was
a revelation, and they yearned to acquire that statuesque
repose that comes so natural to the daughter of an earl.
But Maude told her brother that evening that the Lady
Elfrida was a "prunes and prisms," and was sure to die an
old maid.</p>

<p>Lord Algernon was tall and finely built; he had a profusion
of light brown curly hair, and a pair of large blue
eyes that so reminded Quincy of Alice that he took to the
young lord at once. They rode, played billiards, bowled,
and smoked together.</p>

<p>One afternoon while they were enjoying a sail in the bay,
Quincy inquired of his guest how he liked America.</p><p><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a></p>

<p>"'Pon honor, my dear fellow, I don't know," replied
Lord Algernon. "I came here for a certain purpose, and
have failed miserably. I am going to sail for home in a
week, if my sister will go."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't come to enjoy the pleasures of travel?"
remarked Quincy, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"No! By Jove, I didn't. My sister did, and she supposes
I did. I'm going to tell you the truth, Mr. Sawyer. I
know you will respect my confidence." Quincy nodded.</p>

<p>"The fact is," Lord Algernon continued, "I came over
here to find a girl that I'm in love with, but who ran away
from me as soon as I told her of it."</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Quincy, not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>"That's the deuce of it," replied Lord Algernon; "I
sha'n't know till I find her and ask her. I met her at Nice,
in France; she was with her mother, a Mdme. Archimbault;
the daughter's name was Celeste&mdash;Celeste Archimbault.
They said they were not French, they were French
Canadians; came from America, you know. I was traveling
as plain Algernon Hastings, and I don't think she ever
suspected I was the son of an earl. I proposed one evening.
She said she must speak to her mother, and if I would
come the next evening about seven o'clock, she would give
me her answer, and I thought by the look in her eye that
she herself was willing to say 'Yes' then. But when I called
the next evening they had both gone, no one knew where."</p>

<p>"You are sure she was not an adventuress?" inquired
Quincy. "Excuse the question, my lord, but you really
knew nothing about her?"</p>

<p>"I knew that I loved her," said Lord Algernon, bluntly,
"and I would give half of my fortune to find her. I know
she was a true, pure, beautiful girl, and her mother was as
honest an old lady as you could find in the world."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help you," remarked Quincy.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lord Algernon; "perhaps you may be
able to some day. Don't forget her name, Celeste Archimbault;
<a name="Page_465" id="Page_465"></a>she is slight in figure, graceful in her carriage, ladylike
in her manners. She has dark hair, large, dreamy
black eyes, with a hidden sorrow in them; in fact, a very
handsome brunette. Here is my card, Mr. Sawyer. I will
write my London address on it, and if you ever hear of her,
cable me at once and I'll take the next steamer for
America."</p>

<p>Quincy said that he would, and put the card in his cardcase.</p>

<p>He excused himself to Lord Algernon and his sister that
evening; a prior engagement made it necessary for him to
leave for Boston early next morning, and the farewells
were then spoken. Lord Algernon's last words to Quincy
were whispered in his ear, "Don't forget her name&mdash;Celeste
Archimbault!"</p>

<p>The next Sunday morning Quincy and Leopold, as they
approached Mrs. Gibson's house on the Cliff, found Rosa
Very standing at the little gate. She had on the white
dress that she had worn the Sunday before, but which Leopold
had not seen. Upon her head was a wide-brimmed
straw hat, decked with ribbons and flowers, which intensified
the darkness of her hair and eyes."</p>

<p>"Don't forget her name&mdash;Celeste Archimbault," came
into Quincy's mind, but he said, "Nonsense," to himself,
and dismissed the thought.</p>

<p>"All ready for a walk on the Cliff?" asked Leopold, as he
raised his hat and extended his hand to Rosa. She shook
hands with him and then with Quincy. She opened the
little gate, placed her hand on Leopold's arm and they
walked on up the Cliff Road.</p>

<p>As Quincy entered the little parlor, Alice sprang toward
him with a cry of joy. He caught her in his arms, and this
time one kiss did not suffice, for a dozen were pressed on
hair and brow and cheek and lips.</p>

<p>"It is so long since you went away," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Only one short week," replied Quincy.</p><p><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a></p>

<p>"Short! Those six days have seemed longer than all the
time we were together at Eastborough. I cannot let you
go away from me again," she cried.</p>

<p>"Stay with Me, My Darling, Stay," sang Quincy, in a
low voice, and Alice tried to hide her blushing face upon
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then they sat down and talked the matter over. "I
must leave you," said Quincy, "and only see you occasionally,
and then usually in the presence of others, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" cried Alice, and a sort of frightened look
came into her face.</p>

<p>"Unless you marry me at once," said Quincy. "I don't
mean this minute; say Wednesday of this coming week. I
have a license with me I got in Boston yesterday morning.
We'll be married quietly in this little room, in which you
first told me that you loved me. We could be married in a
big church in Boston, with bridesmaids, and groomsmen,
and music on a big organ. We could make as big a day
of it as they did down to Eastborough."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Alice; "I couldn't go through that. I
cannot see well enough, and I might make some terrible
blunder. I might trip and fall, and then I should be so
nervous and ashamed."</p>

<p>"I will not ask you to go through such an ordeal, my
dearest. I know that we could have all these grand things,
and for that reason, if for no better one, I'm perfectly willing
to go without them. No, Alice, we will be married here
in this room. We will deck it with flowers," continued
Quincy. "Leopold will go to Boston to-morrow and get
them. Rosamond's Bower was not sweeter nor more lovely
than we will make this little room. I will get an old clergyman;
I don't like young ones; Leopold shall be my best
man and Rosa shall be your bridesmaid. Mrs. Gibson and
her brother, who I see is still here, shall be our witnesses,
and we will have Tommy and Dolly for ushers."</p>

<p>Both laughed aloud in their childish glee at the picture
<a name="Page_467" id="Page_467"></a>that Quincy had painted. "I could ask for nothing better,"
said Alice; "the ceremony will be modest, artistic, and
idyllic."</p>

<p>"And economical, too," Quincy added with a laugh.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass! They were married, and the
transformation in the little room, that Quincy and Alice
had seen in their mind's eye, was realized to the letter.
Flowers, best man, bridesmaid, witnesses, ushers, and the
aged clergyman, with whitened locks, who called them his
children, and blessed them and wished them long life and
happiness, hoped that they would meet and know each
other some day in the infinite&mdash;all were there.</p>

<p>This was on Wednesday. On Thursday came a letter
from Aunt Ella. It contained the most kindly congratulations,
and a neat little wedding present of a check for fifty
thousand dollars. She wrote further that she was lonesome
and wanted somebody to read to her, and talk to her, and
sing to her. If the book was done, would not Miss Very
come to spend the remainder of the season with her, and if
Mr. Ernst was there could he not spare time to escort Miss
Very.</p>

<p>That same evening Leopold received a letter from Mr.
Morton. It simply read, "Blennerhassett accepted; will
be put in type at once and issued by the first of November,
perhaps sooner."</p>

<p>The next morning Leopold and Rosa started for Old
Orchard, and the lovers were left alone to pass their honeymoon,
with the blue sea about them, the blue sky above
them, and a love within their hearts which grew stronger
day by day.</p><p><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"></a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<h3>LINDA'S BIRTHRIGHT.<br /></h3>

<p>For Quincy and Alice, day after day, and week after
week, found them in a state of complete happiness.
The little island floating in the azure sea was their world,
and for the time, no thought of any other intruded upon
their delightful Eden. It seemed to Quincy all a blissful
dream of love, and everything he looked upon was wreathed
in flowers and golden sunshine.</p>

<p>But lotus land is not so far distant from the abodes of
mortal man but that his emissaries may reach it. The first
jarring note in the sweet harmony of their married life
came in the form of a letter from Dr. Culver, who wrote to
remind Quincy that it would soon be time to start in
ploughing the political field. Quincy's reply was brief and
to the point.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Culver</span>:&mdash;I will see you in Boston on the tenth
of September.
</p>
<p class="right1">Q.A.S."</p>

<p>When Aunt Ella learned that her nephew was going to
town, she made hurried preparations for her departure from
Old Orchard, and wrote to him insisting that he and Alice
should come and stay with her. This invitation they gladly
accepted, Quincy arranging in his mind to explain matters
to his family by saying that, as he had now entered politics
and would necessarily have a great many callers to entertain,
he thought it best to make his headquarters with Aunt
Ella until the campaign was over.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the ninth of September saw them located
at Mt Vernon Street. On the very day of their arrival,
<a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"></a>proof of the remaining stories and a large instalment of
Blennerhassett reached them, with a note from Ernst:</p>

<p>"Please rush. Press is waiting."</p>

<p>Miss Very's assistance was now absolutely necessary,
but when Quincy asked Leopold for her address, he was
surprised at the reply he received.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen her," said Leopold, "since we came back
from Old Orchard together. In fact, since that time, our
relations, for some reason or other, have undergone a great
change. However, I think I can help you out. I don't
believe in keeping a good friend like you, Quincy, in suspense,
so I will tell you the truth. I am married. My
wife is fully as competent to assist Mrs. Sawyer as Miss
Very would have been. She is in the library now at work.
I will go and ask her."</p>

<p>He entered the room, closing the door behind him.
Quincy threw himself rather discontentedly into a chair.
He fancied he heard laughing in the next room, but he
knew Alice would be disappointed, and he himself felt in
no mood for laughter.</p>

<p>Leopold opened the library door. "Quincy, I've induced
her to undertake the task," he said. "Do spare a moment
from your work, Mrs. Ernst; I wish to introduce to you
Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer, the husband of the author of
that coming literary sensation, Blennerhassett. Mr. Sawyer,"
he continued, "allow me to present you to my wife,
Mrs. Rosa Ernst." And as he said this, Leopold and Rosa
stood side by side in the doorway.</p>

<p>"When did you do it?" finally ejaculated Quincy, rushing
forward and grasping each by the hand. "Leopold, I owe
you one." And then they all laughed together.</p>

<p>By some means, Dr. Culver said by the liberal use
of money, Barker Dalton secured the regular nomination
from Quincy's party. The latter kept his word
and entered the field as an independent candidate. A
hot contest followed. The papers were full of the
<a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"></a>speeches of the opposing candidates, and incidents connected
with their lives. But in none relating to Quincy
was a word said about his marriage, and the fact
was evidently unknown, except to a limited few. When
the polls closed on election day and the vote was
declared, it was found that Sawyer had a plurality of two
hundred and twenty-eight and a clear majority of twenty-two
over both Dalton and Burke, the opposing candidates.
Then the papers were full of compliments for Mr. Sawyer,
who had so successfully fought corruption and bribery in
his own party, and won such a glorious victory.</p>

<p>But Quincy never knew that the Hon. Nathaniel Adams
Sawyer had used all his influence to secure his son's election,
and for every dollar expended by Dalton, the Hon.
Nathaniel had covered it with a two or five if necessary.</p>

<p>The publication of Blennerhassett had been heralded by
advance notices that appeared in the press during the month
of October.</p>

<p>These notices had been adroitly written. Political prejudices,
one notice said, would no doubt be aroused by statements
made in the book, and one newspaper went so far
as to publish a double-leaded editorial protesting against
the revival of party animosities buried more than two generations
ago. The leaven worked, and when the book was
placed in the stores on the eleventh of November, the demand
for it was unparalleled. Orders came for it from all
parts of the country, particularly from the State of New
York, and the resources of the great publishing house of
Hinckley, Morton, &amp; Co. were taxed to the utmost to meet
the demand.</p>

<p>While Quincy was fighting Dalton in the political field,
another campaign was being planned in the clever diplomatic
brain of Aunt Ella. It related to the introduction of
Alice, the "farmer's daughter," to the proud patrician family
of Sawyer, as Quincy's wife&mdash;no easy matter to accomplish
satisfactorily, as all agreed.</p><p><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"></a></p>

<p>The initial step was taken a couple of weeks after
Thanksgiving, when a daintily-engraved card was issued
from Mt. Vernon Street, which read:</p>

<p>"Your company is respectfully requested on the evening
of the tenth of December at a reception to be given to
Bruce Douglas, the author of Blennerhassett."</p>

<p>One evening, Quincy ran up the steps of the Mt. Vernon
Street house. He opened the door and started to run up
the stairs to his wife's room, as was his custom, when he
came into collision with a young lady, who, upon closer inspection,
he found to be his sister Maude.</p>

<p>"Come in here," she said. She grasped him by the arm,
and, dragging him into the parlor, she closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Man!" she cried, "I've found you out, but
horses sha'n't drag it out of me. No, Quincy, you're
always right, and I won't peach. But 'twas mean not to tell
me."</p>

<p>Quincy looked at her in voiceless astonishment. "What
do you mean, Maude, and where did you gather up all that
slang?"</p>

<p>"I might ask you," said Maude, "where you found your
wife. I've been talking to her upstairs. She must have
thought that papa and mamma knew all about it, for she
told me who she was, just as easy. Who is she, Quincy?"</p>

<p>He drew his sister down beside him on a sofa. "She was
Miss Mary Alice Pettengill. She is now known to a limited
few, of which you, sister Maude, are one, as Mrs.
Mary Alice Sawyer; but she is known to a wide circle of
readers as Bruce Douglas, the author of many popular
stories, as also of that celebrated book entitled Blennerhassett."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" cried Maude; "why, papa is wild over that
book. He's been reading it aloud to us evenings, and he
said last night that that young man&mdash;you hear, Quincy?&mdash;that
<a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"></a>young man, had brought the truth to the surface at
last."</p>

<p>"Now, Maude," said Quincy, "you go right home and
keep your mouth shut a little while longer, and when you
are sixteen"&mdash;"the ninth of next January," broke in
Maude&mdash;"I'll give you a handsome gold watch, with my
picture in it."</p>

<p>"I don't have to be paid to keep your secrets, Quincy,"
replied Maude archly, as Quincy kissed her.</p>

<p>"I know it, dear," said Quincy; "I'll give you the watch,
not as pay, but to show my gratitude."</p>

<p>Quincy took an early opportunity to explain to his wife
his remissness in not informing his parents of his marriage,
and disclosed to her Aunt Ella's plan.</p>

<p>On the tenth, Mrs. Chessman's spacious parlor was
thronged from nine till eleven o'clock with bright and
shining lights, representing the musical, artistic, literary,
and social culture of Boston. Among the guests were the
Hon. Nathaniel Adams Sawyer, his wife, and his daughters,
Florence and Maude. The surprise of the visitors at
the discovery that Bruce Douglas was a young woman was
followed by one of great pleasure at finding her beautiful
and affable.</p>

<p>The reception and entertainment were acknowledged on
all sides to have been most successful, and a thoroughly
pleased and satisfied company had spoken their farewells
to author and hostess by quarter-past eleven. So, when
Quincy came up Walnut Street and glanced across at his
aunt's house, a little before twelve, he found the windows
dark and the occupants, presumably, in their beds.</p>

<p>As part of her plan, Quincy had been advised by Aunt
Ella to stay away from the reception, to spend the night
at his father's house, and to be sure and take breakfast
with them, so as to hear what was said about the previous
evening.</p><p><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473"></a></p>

<p>As soon as the morning meal was over, Quincy ran
quickly upstairs, seized his hand-bag, which he always kept
packed, ready for an emergency, and in a very short space
of time, reached Mt. Vernon Street. He found his wife
and aunt in the den. The latter was reading a manuscript
to Alice.</p>

<p>As soon as the greetings were over, and a little time
given to discussing the reception, Quincy asked: "Who is
this Mr. Fernborough that Maude told me about this
morning?"</p>

<p>"He is an English gentleman," explained Alice, "who
has come to this country to see if he can find any trace of
an only daughter, who ran away from home with an American
more than thirty years ago, and who, he thinks, came
to this country with her husband. His wife is dead, he is
alone in the world, and he is ready to forgive her and care
for her, if she needs it."</p>

<p>"He hasn't hurried himself about it, has he?" said
Quincy; "but why did he come to you?"</p>

<p>"That's the strange part of it," Alice replied, "He said he
thoughtlessly picked up a magazine at a hotel where he
was staying, and his eye fell upon my story, How He Lost
Both Name and Fortune. He read it, and sought me out,
to ask if it were fiction, or whether it was founded on some
true incident. He was quite disappointed when I told him
it was entirely a work of the imagination."</p>

<p>"Did he say what hotel?" asked Quincy.</p>

<p>"No," replied Alice; "but why are you so interested in a
total stranger?"</p>

<p>Then Quincy told the story of the broken envelope&mdash;the
little piece of cloth&mdash;and the name, Linda Fernborough.</p>

<p>"I must find him at once," said he, "for I have an impression
that his daughter must have been Lindy Putnam's
real mother. You gave me my reward, Alice, before my
quest was successful, but I gave my word to find her for
<a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a>you, and I shall not consider myself fully worthy of you
till that word is kept."</p>

<p>"But what did your father and mother say?" broke in
Aunt Ella.</p>

<p>"My father took me to task," began Quincy, "for not
being present at the reception, but I told him I had to see
Culver on some political business. Then he remarked that
I missed a very pleasant evening. He complimented Aunt
Ella, here, for her skill as an entertainer, and expressed
his surprise that Bruce Douglas, instead of being a young
man, was a young and very beautiful woman. Yes, Aunt
Ella, he actually called my wife here a very beautiful young
woman."</p>

<p>"That is a capital beginning!" cried Aunt Ella. "Go on,
Quincy."</p>

<p>"In order to continue the conversation, I ventured the
remark that Bruce Douglas came from an ordinary country
family and one not very well off; for which aspersion, I
humbly ask your pardon, Mrs. Sawyer. Father replied
that he thought that I must have been misinformed; that
Bruce Douglas was worth fifty thousand dollars in her own
right, and he added that she would become a very wealthy
woman if she kept up her literary activity."</p>

<p>"What did sister Sarah say?" asked Aunt Ella.</p>

<p>"Well," said Quincy, "I resolved to do something desperate,
so I asked: 'Doesn't she look countrified?' again
asking your pardon, Mrs. Sawyer."</p>

<p>"No," said mother, "she has the repose of a Lady Clara
Vere de Vere, and is as correct in her speech as was the
Lady Elfrida Hastings."</p>

<p>"It will come out all right," cried Aunt Ella; and Quincy,
kissing his aunt and wife, and promising to write or telegraph
every day, caught up his hand-bag and started forth
in search of the Hon. Stuart Fernborough, M.P.</p>

<p>When Quincy left his aunt's house he had not the slightest
idea which way would be the best to turn his footsteps.<a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a>
He commenced his search, however, at the Revere House,
then he tried the American House, but at neither place was
Mr. Fernborough a guest.</p>

<p>At the Quincy House the clerk was busy with a number
of new arrivals. He had just opened a new hotel register,
and the old one lay upon the counter. Quincy took it
up, and turning over the leaves, glanced up and down its
pages. Suddenly he started back; then, holding the book
closer to his eyes he read it again. There it was, under the
date of September 10, "Mdme. Rose Archimbault and
daughter." The residence given in the proper column was
"New York." Quincy kept the book open at the place
where he found this entry until the clerk was at leisure.
He remembered Mdme. Archimbault and daughter in a
general way. He was sure that they arrived from Europe
the day that they came to the hotel, and he was equally
sure that they went to New York when they left. What
made him positive was that he remembered asking the
young lady when she wrote New York in the register if she
had not just returned from Europe. She said yes, but that
her home residence was in New York.</p>

<p>Quincy thanked the clerk, and started forth again in
search of the elusive Mr. Fernborough. A visit to Young's,
Parker's, and the Tremont furnished no clue, and Quincy
was wondering whether his search, after all, was destined to
be fruitless, when he thought of a small hotel in Central
Court, which led from Washington Street, a little south of
Summer Street.</p>

<p>It was noted for its English roast beef, Yorkshire mutton
chops, and musty ale, and might be just the sort of
place that an English gentleman would put up at, provided
he had been informed of its whereabouts.</p>

<p>On his way Quincy dropped into the Marlborough, but
Mr. Fernborough had not been there, and Quincy imagined
that the little hotel in Central Court was his last hope.</p>

<p>His persistence was rewarded. Mr. Fernborough was
<a name="Page_476" id="Page_476"></a>not only a guest, but he was in his room. Quincy sent up
his card, and in a very short time was shown into the presence
of a courtly gentleman, between sixty and seventy
years of age. His face was smooth shaven, and had a firm
but not hard expression. His eyes, however, showed that
he was weighed down by some sorrow, which the unyielding
expression of his face indicated that he would bear in
silence rather than seek sympathy from others.</p>

<p>Quincy's story was soon told. The old gentleman listened
with breathless interest, and when at the close Quincy
said, "What do you think?" Mr. Fernborough cried, "It
must be she, my daughter's child. There are no other
Fernboroughs in England, and Linda has been a family
name for generations. Heaven bless you, young man, for
your kindly interest, and take me to my grandchild at once.
She is the only tie that binds me to earth. All the others
are dead and gone."</p>

<p>The old gentleman broke down completely, and for several
minutes was unable to speak.</p>

<p>Quincy waited until his emotion had somewhat subsided.
Then he said, "I am at your service, sir; we will do our
best to find her. I have a feeling that she is in New York,
but not a single fact to prove it. We can take the one
o'clock train, if you desire."</p>

<p>The old gentleman began at once to prepare for the journey.
Quincy told him he would meet him at the hotel
office, and from there he sent a note to Aunt Ella informing
her of his intended departure.</p>

<p>Arriving in New York they were driven at once to the
Fifth Avenue Hotel. Quincy prevailed upon Sir Stuart
to retire at once, telling him that he would prepare an advertisement
and have it in the next morning's issue of the
"New York Herald."</p>

<p>Quincy wrote out two advertisements and sent them by
special messenger to the newspaper office. The first one
<a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"></a>read: "Linda: important paper not destroyed, as suspected.
Communicate at once with Eastborough, 'Herald' office."
The second was worded as follows: "Celeste A&mdash;&mdash;t:
an American friend has a message for you from me. Send
your address at once to Eastborough, 'Herald' office.
<span class="smcap">Algernon H</span>."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="image11" id="image11" href="images/image11.png">
    <img src="images/image11-tn.png" alt="Alice Recovers Her Sight (Act IV.)"
           title="Alice Recovers Her Sight (Act IV.)" />
  </a>
  <p class="caption">Alice Recovers Her Sight (Act IV.)</p>
</div>

<p>Then began the days of weary waiting; the careful examination
of the "Herald" each morning, to be sure that the
advertisements were in, for both had been paid for a week
in advance. The request for mail made every morning at
the "Herald" office received a stereotyped "no" for answer;
then he vowed that he would advertise no more, but would
enlist other aids in the search.</p>

<p>On the morning of the eighth day Quincy stood upon
the steps of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. He was undecided
which way to go. It is in such cases of absolute uncertainty
that unseen powers should give their aid, if they
ever do, for then it is most needed. He did not hear any
angels' voices, but he crossed over Broadway and started
up town on the right-hand side of that great thoroughfare.
As he walked on he glanced at the shop windows, for they
were resplendent with holiday gifts, for Christmas was only
one short week away.</p>

<p>Just beyond the corner of Broadway and Twenty-ninth
Street his attention was attracted by a wax figure in a milliner's
window. The face and golden hair reminded him
of his wife, and he thought how pretty Alice would look
in the hat that was upon the head of the figure. His first
inclination was to go in and buy it, then he thought that it
would make an unhandy package to carry with him, and
besides his taste might not be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thinking, however, that he might return and purchase
it, he glanced up at the sign. One look and he gave a sudden
start backward, coming violently in contact with a
gentleman who was passing. Quincy's apology was accepted
and the gentleman passed on, giving his right
<a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a>shoulder an occasional pressure to make sure that it was
not dislocated. Then Quincy took another look at the
sign to make sure that he had not been mistaken. On it he
read, in large golden letters, "Mdme. Archimbault."</p>

<p>It was but the work of an instant for Quincy to enter the
store and approach the only attendant, who was behind the
counter nearest the door.</p>

<p>"Could I see Mdme. Archimbault?" he inquired in the
politest possible manner.</p>

<p>"Ze madame eez seeck zis morning, monsieur, mais ze
Mademoiselle Celeste eez in ze boudoir."</p>

<p>As she said this she pointed to a partition with windows
of ground glass, which extended across the farther end of
the store, evidently forming a private department for trying
on hats and bonnets. Quincy said nothing, but taking
out his cardcase passed one to the attendant.</p>

<p>The girl walked towards the boudoir, opened the door
and entered. Quincy followed her, and was but a few feet
from the door when it was closed. He heard a woman's
voice say, "What is it, Hortense?" And the girl's reply
was distinctly audible. This is what she said, "A veezitor,
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>An instant's silence, followed by a smothered cry of astonishment,
evidently from mademoiselle. Then ensued
a short conversation, carried on in whispers. Then Hortense
emerged from the boudoir, and facing Quincy said,
"Ze mademoiselle weel not zee you. She has no desire to
continue ze acquaintance."</p>

<p>As she said this she stepped behind the counter, evidently
thinking that Quincy would accept the rebuff and
depart. Instead of doing this he took a step forward,
which brought him between Hortense and the door of the
boudoir. Turning to the girl he said in a low tone, "There
must be some mistake. I have never met Mademoiselle
Archimbault. I will go in and explain the purpose of my
visit." And before Hortense could prevent him, Quincy
<a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a>had entered the boudoir and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room stood a beautifully carved and
inlaid table. Before it sat an elegantly-dressed woman,
whose hair, artistically arranged, was of the darkest shade
of brown&mdash;almost black. Her arms were crossed upon the
table, her face was buried in them, and from her came a
succession of convulsive sobs, that indicated she was in
great physical or mental distress.</p>

<p>Quincy felt that she knew he was there, but he did not
speak.</p>

<p>Finally she said, and there was a tone of deep suffering
in her voice: "Oh! Algernon, why have you followed me?
I can never, never marry you. If it had been possible I
would have met you that evening, as I promised."</p>

<p>The thought flashed across Quincy's mind, "This is the
girl that ran away from Lord Hastings. But why did she
call me Algernon?" Then he spoke for the first time.
"Mademoiselle, there is some misunderstanding; my name
is not Algernon. I am not Lord Hastings."</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked at the woman seated at the table.
She looked up; there was an instantaneous, mutual recognition.
In her astonishment she cried out, "Mr. Sawyer!"</p>

<p>As these words fell from her lips, Quincy said to himself,
"Thank God! she's found at last." But the only words
that he spoke aloud were, "Lindy Putnam!"</p>

<p>"Why do I find you here," asked Quincy, "and under
this name? Why have you not answered my advertisements
in the 'Herald?'" And he sank into a chair on the
other side of the little table.</p>

<p>The revulsion of feeling was so great at his double discovery
that he came nearer being unmanned than ever before
in his life.</p>

<p>"How did you come by this card!" asked Mademoiselle
Archimbault in a broken voice. "When you have explained,
I will answer your questions."</p>

<p>Quincy took the card from her hand and glanced at it.<a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"></a>
"What a big blunder I made and yet what a fortunate one,"
cried he, for he now saw that he had sent in Lord Hastings's
card bearing the London address. "Lord Hastings
himself gave it to me," he continued. "He was a guest at
my father's cottage at Nahant last summer. He came to
America and spent three months vainly searching for you.
He loves you devotedly, and made me promise that if I
ever found you I would cable at once to the address on
that card, and he said he would come to America on the
next steamer. Of course when I made that promise I did
not know that Lindy Putnam and Celeste Archimbault
were one and the same person."</p>

<p>"But knowing it as you now do, Mr. Sawyer, you will
not send him any word. Give me your solemn promise
you will not. I cannot marry him. You know I cannot.
There is no Lindy Putnam, and Celeste Archimbault has
no right to the name she bears."</p>

<p>"Did you come to New York when you left Eastborough,
as you promised you would?" inquired Quincy.</p>

<p>"No, I did not, Mr. Sawyer," said she. "Forgive me,
but I could not. I was distracted, almost heartbroken
when I reached Boston the day she died. She had robbed
me of all hope of ever finding my relatives, and but for
my hatred of her I believe I would have had brain fever.
One thing I could not do, I would not do. I would not
remain in America. I was rich, I would travel and try to
drown my sorrow and my hatred. I did not go to a hotel,
for I did not wish any one to find me. What good could
it do? I looked in the 'Transcript' and found a boarding
place. There I met Mdme. Archimbault, a widow, a
French-Canadian lady, who had come to Boston in search
of a niece who had left her home in Canada some five years
before. Mdme. Archimbault had spent all the money she
had in her unavailing search for her relative, and she told
me, with tears in her eyes and expressive French gestures,
that she would have to sell her jewelry to pay her board,
<a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a>as she had no way of making a living in a foreign land.
Then I told her part of my story. She was sure her niece
was dead, and so I asked her to be my mother, to let me
take her name and be known as her daughter. I told her
I was rich and that I would care for her as long as our compact
was kept and the real truth not known. My visit to
Nice and my meeting with Algernon Hastings, he has no
doubt told you. I did not know he was a lord, but I suspected
it. So much the more reason why he should not
marry a nameless waif, a poor girl with no father or mother
and all hope lost of ever finding them. I came back to
America with Mdme. Archimbault, covering my tracks by
cross journeys and waits which he could not anticipate.
We landed in Boston."</p>

<p>"I found your names in the Quincy House register," remarked
Quincy.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could escape from you as easily as I did
from him," she said, the first faint sign of a smile showing
itself upon her face. "I went to my bankers in Boston
and told them that I had been adopted by a wealthy French
lady named Archimbault. I informed them that we were
going to return to France at once. They made up my account,
and I found I was worth nearly one hundred and
forty thousand dollars. I took my fortune in New York
drafts, explaining that madame wished to visit relatives in
New York, and that we should sail for France from that
port. I did this so my bankers could not disclose my
whereabouts to any one. We came here, but I could not
remain idle. I always had a natural taste for millinery
work, so I proposed to madame that we should open a
store under her name. We did this late in September,
and have had great success since our opening day. Now
you know all about me, Mr. Sawyer. Give me your promise
that you will not tell Lord Hastings where I am."</p>

<p>"Then," said Quincy, "you do not know why I am here."</p><p><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484"></a></p>

<p>"To keep your word to Lord Hastings, I presume.
What other reason could you have?"</p>

<p>"Then you have not read the Personal Column in the
'New York Herald?'" Quincy inquired.</p>

<p>"No," said she. "Why should I?"</p>

<p>Quincy took a copy of the paper from his pocket, laid it
upon the table and pointed with his finger to the word
"Linda." She read the advertisement, then looked up to
him with distended eyes, full of questioning.</p>

<p>"What does the paper say? It could not have disclosed
much or you would not have waited so long to tell me."</p>

<p>Then Quincy related the story of the sealed package,
how it had been given to Alice Pettengill long before Mrs.
Putnam died; how Miss Pettengill had sworn to destroy it,
but would not when she learned that it might possibly contain
information relating to her parents. He told her that
Miss Pettengill would not allow any one to read it but herself;
and how he had promised to search for her until he
found her. Then he related the incident at the lawyer's
office and the piece of cloth bearing the name, "Linda Fernborough,"
"which," said Quincy, "I think must have been
your mother's maiden name." He did not tell her of the
old gentleman only five blocks away, ready and willing to
claim her as his granddaughter without further proof than
that little piece of doth.</p>

<p>Quincy looked at his watch. "I have just time," said
he, "to get the one o'clock train for Boston. I will obtain
the papers to-morrow morning, and be in New York again
to-morrow night. The next morning early I will be at
your residence with the papers, and let us hope that they
will contain such information as will disclose your parentage
and give you a name that you can rightfully bear."</p>

<p>She wrote her home address on a card and passed it to
him.</p>

<p>He gave her hand a quick, firm pressure and left the
store, not even glancing at Hortense, who gazed at him
<a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a>with wonderment. He hailed a hack and was driven to
the hotel. He found Sir Stuart and told him that he had
found his supposed granddaughter, but that he must wait
until he returned from Boston with the papers, that his
wife's feelings must be respected, and that the document
could only be opened and read by the person who had been
known to her as Lindy Putnam.</p>

<p>Quincy reached Mt. Vernon Street about eight o'clock
that evening. His wife and aunt listened eagerly to the
graphic recital of his search. He pictured the somewhat
sensational episode in the boudoir in the most expressive
language, and Alice remarked that Quincy was fast gathering
the materials for a most exciting romance; while Aunt
Ella declared that the disclosure of the dual personality of
Linda and Celeste would form a most striking theatrical
tableau.</p>

<p>Aunt Ella informed him that she had been requested by
Mr. and Mrs. Nathaniel Adams Sawyer to extend an invitation
to Miss Bruce Douglas to dine with them on any
day that might be convenient for her. "I was included in
the invitation, of course," Aunt Ella added. "What day
had we better fix, Quincy?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Make it Christmas," replied Quincy. "Tell them Miss
Bruce Douglas has invitations for every other day but
that for a month to come. What a precious gift I shall
present to my father," said he, caressing his wife, who laid
her fair head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Do you think he will be pleased?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"I don't know which will please him most," replied
Quincy, "the fact that such a talented addition has been
made to the family, or the knowledge, which will surely
surprise him, that his son was smart enough to win such a
prize."</p>

<p>The next morning Quincy arose early and was at Curtis
Carter's office as soon as it was opened. Alice had signed
an order for the delivery of the package to him and he presented
<a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a>it to Mr. Carter's clerk, to whom he was well known.
The ponderous doors of the big safe were thrown open and
the precious document was produced. When the clerk
passed the package to him and took Alice's order therefor,
Quincy noticed that a five-dollar bill was pinned to the envelope;
a card was also attached to the bill, upon which was
written: "This money belongs to Mr. Quincy Sawyer; he
dropped it the last time he was in the office."</p>

<p>Quincy would not trust the package to his hand-bag, but
placed it in an inside pocket of his coat, which he tightly
buttoned. After leaving the lawyer's office he dropped
into Grodjinski's, and purchased a box of fine cigars. He
had the clerk tack one of his cards on the top of the box.
On this he wrote:</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">My Dear Curtis</span>:&mdash;Keep the ashes for me; they make
good tooth powder.
</p>
<p class="right1"><span class="smcap">Quincy</span>."</p>

<p>The box was then done up and addressed to Curtis Carter,
Esq., the clerk promising to have it delivered at once.</p>

<p>Quincy had found a letter at his aunt's from Mr. Strout,
asking him to buy a line of fancy groceries and confectionery
for Christmas trade, and it was noon before he had
attended to the matter to his complete satisfaction. A
hasty lunch and he was once more on his way to New York,
and during the trip his hand sought the inside pocket of his
coat a score of times, that he might feel assured that the
precious document was still there.</p>

<p>Arriving, Quincy proceeded at once to the Fifth Avenue
Hotel. Sir Stuart was eagerly awaiting his arrival, and
his first question was, "Have you the papers?"</p>

<p>Quincy took the package from his pocket and placed it
on the table before him, remarking as he did so, "It must
not be opened until to-morrow morning, and then by the
young lady herself."</p>

<p>The old man pushed the package away from him and
<a name="Page_487" id="Page_487"></a>turned a stern face toward Quincy. "I yield obedience,"
said he, "to your wife's command, but if one man or two
stood now between me and my darling's child, I would
have their lives, if they tried to keep her from my arms for
one instant even."</p>

<p>After a little reflection he apologized for his vehement
language, and sought his room to think, and hope, and wait&mdash;but
not to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, a little before nine o'clock, a carriage
containing two gentlemen stopped before a modest brick
dwelling in West Forty-first Street. A servant admitted
them and showed them into the little parlor. The room
was empty. Quincy pointed to a sofa at the farther end of
the room, and Sir Stuart took a seat thereon. Quincy
stepped into the entry and greeted Celeste, who was just
descending the stairs.</p>

<p>"Sir Stuart Fernborough is in your parlor," said he; "he
may be, and I hope to Heaven he is, your grandfather, but
you must control your feelings until you know the truth.
Come and sit by me, near the window, and read what is
written in this package, so loud that he can hear every
word." As he said this he placed the package, which might
or might not prove her honorable heritage, in her hands.</p>

<p>They entered the room and took seats near the window.
Celeste opened the package with trembling fingers. As
she did so that little telltale piece of cloth, bearing the
name "Linda Fernborough," once more fell upon the floor.
Quincy picked it up, and held it during the reading of the
letter, for a letter it proved to be.</p>

<p>It had no envelope, but was folded in the old-fashioned
way, so as to leave a blank space on the back of the last
sheet for the address. The address was, "Mr. Silas Putnam,
Hanover, New Hampshire."</p>

<p>Celeste began to read in a clear voice: "Dear brother
Silas."</p>

<p>"Is there no date?" asked Quincy.</p><p><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488"></a></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Celeste, "March 18, 183&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Thirty years ago," said Quincy.</p>

<p>Celeste read on:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother Silas</span>:&mdash;You will, no doubt, be surprised
to find I am in this town when I usually go to Gloucester
or Boston, but the truth is I had a strange adventure during
my last fishing trip on the Polly Sanders, and I thought
I would come into port as close to you as I could. About
ten days ago I had a good catch on the Banks and sailed
for home, bound for Boston. A heavy fog came up, and
we lay to for more than twenty-four hours. During the
night, heard cries, and my mate, Jim Brown, stuck to it
that some ship must have run ashore; and he was right,
for when the fog lifted we saw the masts of a three-master
sticking out of water, close on shore, and about a mile
from where we lay. We up sail and ran down as close as
we dared to see if there was anybody living on the wreck.
We couldn't see anybody, but I sent out Jim Brown with
a boat to make a thorough search. In about an hour he
came back, bringing a half-drowned woman and just the
nicest, chubbiest, little black-eyed girl baby that you ever
saw in your life. Jim said the woman was lashed to a spar,
and when he first saw her, there was a man in the water
swimming and trying to push the spar towards the land,
but before he reached him the man sunk and he didn't get
another sight of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor father!" cried Celeste. The letter dropped
from her hands and the tears rushed into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Shall I finish reading it?" asked Quincy, picking up the
letter.</p>

<p>Celeste nodded, and he read on:</p>

<p>"I gave the woman some brandy and she came to long
enough to tell me who she was. She said her name was<a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a>
Linda Chester or Chessman, I couldn't tell just which. Her
husband's name was Charles, and he was an artist. He
had a brother in Boston named Robert, and they were on
their way to that city. The wrecked ship was the Canadian
Belle, bound from Liverpool to Boston. I didn't tell
her her husband was drowned. I gave her some more
brandy and she came to again and said her husband left a
lot of pictures in London with Roper &amp; Son, on Ludgate
Hill. I asked her where she came from and she said from
Heathfield, in Sussex. She said no more and we couldn't
bring her to again. She died in about an hour and we buried
her at sea. I noticed that her nightdress had a name
stamped on it different from what she gave me, and so I
cut it out and send it in this letter. Now, I've heard you
and Heppy say that if you could find a nice little girl baby
that you would adopt her and bring her up. I sold out my
cargo at Portland, and so I've put in here, and I'll stay
till you and Heppy have time to drive down here and make
up your minds whether you'll take this handsome little baby
off my hands. Come right along, quick, for I must be off
to the Banks again soon. From your brother,</p>

<p class="right7"><span class="smcap">Obed Putnam</span>,</p>
<p class="right1">Captain of the Polly Sanders.</p>

<p>"Portsmouth Harbor, N.H.</p>

<p>"P.S. The baby was a year old the eighth of last January.
Its name is Linda Fernborough Chessman."</p>

<p>The tears had welled up again in the young girl's eyes,
when Quincy read of the death of her mother and her
burial at sea. His own hand trembled perceptibly when
he realized that the young woman before him, though not
his cousin, was yet connected by indisputable ties of relationship
to his own aunt, Mrs. Ella Chessman. Following
his usual habit of reticence he kept silence, thinking that it
<a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a>would be inappropriate to detract in any way from the
happy reunion of grandfather and granddaughter.</p>

<p>Sir Stuart had scarcely moved during the reading of the
letter. He had sat with his right hand covering his eyes,
but yet evidently listening attentively to each word as it
fell from the reader's lips. As Quincy folded up the letter
and passed it back to Linda, Sir Stuart arose and came forward
to the front part of the room. Quincy took Linda's
hand and led her towards Mr. Fernborough. Then he
said, "Sir Stuart, I think this letter proves conclusively that
this young lady's real name is Linda Fernborough Chessman.
I knew personally Mr. Silas Putnam, mentioned in
the letter, and scores of others can bear testimony that she
has lived nearly all her life with this Silas Putnam, and has
been known to all as his adopted daughter. There is no
doubt but that the Linda Fernborough who was buried at
sea was her mother. If you are satisfied that Mrs. Charles
Chessman was your daughter, it follows that this young
lady must be your granddaughter."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt of it in my mind," said Sir Stuart,
taking both of Linda's hands in his. "I live at Fernborough
Hall, which is located in Heathfield, in the county of
Sussex. But, my dear, I did not know until to-day that my
poor daughter had a child, and it will take me just a little
time to get accustomed to the fact. Old men's brains do
not act as quickly as my young friend's here." As he said
this he looked towards Quincy. "But I am sure that we
both of us owe to him a debt of gratitude that it will be
difficult for us ever to repay."</p>

<p>The old gentleman drew Linda towards him and folded
her tenderly in his arms. "Come, rest here, my dear one,"
said he; "your doubts and hopes, your troubles and trials,
and your wanderings are over." He kissed her on the forehead,
and Linda put her arms about his neck and laid her
head upon his breast.</p>

<p>"You are the only one united to me by near ties of blood
<a name="Page_491" id="Page_491"></a>in the world," Sir Stuart continued, and he laid his hand
on Linda's head and turned her face towards him. "You
have your mother's eyes," he said. "We will go back to
England, and Fernborough Hall will have a mistress once
more. You are English born, and have a right to sit in that
seat which might have been your mother's but for the
pride and prejudice which thirty years ago ruled both your
grandmother and myself."</p>

<p>Leaving them to talk over future plans, Quincy went
back to the hotel and wrote two letters. The first was
addressed to Lord Algernon Hastings in London. The
other was a brief note to Aunt Ella, informing her that a
party of four would start for Boston on the morning train
and that she might expect them about four o'clock in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>It lacked but five minutes of that hour when a carriage,
containing the party from New York, stopped before the
Mt. Vernon Street house. It suited Quincy's purpose that
his companions should first meet his wife, although the
fact that she was his wife was as yet unknown to them.</p>

<p>The meeting between Alice and Linda was friendly, but
not effusive. They had been ordinary acquaintances in
the old days at Eastborough, but now a mutual satisfaction
and pleasure drew them more closely together.</p>

<p>"I have come," said Linda, "to thank you, Miss Pettengill,
for your kindness and justice to me. Few women
would have disregarded the solemn oath that Mrs. Putnam
forced you to take, but by doing so you have given me a
lawful name and a life of happiness for the future. May
every blessing that Heaven can send to you be yours."</p>

<p>"All the credit should not be given to me," replied Alice.
"The morning after Mrs. Putnam's death I was undecided
in my mind which course to follow, whether to destroy the
paper or to keep it. It was a few words from my Uncle
Isaac that enabled me to decide the matter. He told me
that a promise made to the dead should not be carried out
<a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"></a>if it interfered with the just rights of the living. So I
decided to keep the paper, but how? It was then that Mr.
Sawyer came to the rescue and pointed out to me the line
of action, which I am truly happy to learn has ended so
pleasantly."</p>

<p>"Grandpa and I have both thanked Mr. Sawyer so much,"
said Linda, "that he will not listen to us any more, but I
will write to Uncle Ike, for I used to call him by that name,
and show him that I am not ungrateful. I have lost all my
politeness, I am so happy," continued Linda; "I believe
you have met grandpa."</p>

<p>Sir Stuart came forward, and, in courtly but concise language,
expressed his sincere appreciation of the kind service
that Miss Pettengill had rendered his granddaughter.</p>

<p>Then Linda introduced Mdme. Archimbault as one who
had been a true friend and almost a mother to her in the
hours of her deepest sorrow and distress.</p>

<p>"Now, my friends," said Quincy, "I have a little surprise
for you myself. I believe it my duty to state the situation
frankly to you. My father is a very wealthy man&mdash;a millionaire.
He is proud of his wealth and still more proud of
the honored names of Quincy and Adams, which he conferred
upon me. Like all such fathers and mothers, my
parents have undoubtedly had bright dreams as to the future
of their only son. One of their dreams has, no doubt,
been my marriage to some young lady of honored name
and great wealth. In such a matter, however, my own mind
must decide. I have acted without their knowledge, as I
resolved to deprive them of the pleasure of my wife's acquaintance
until Christmas day."</p>

<p>Stepping up to Alice, Quincy took her hand and led her
forward, facing their guests. "I take great pleasure, my
friends, in introducing to you my wife, Mrs. Quincy Adams
Sawyer."</p>

<p>There came an exclamation of pleased surprise from
Linda, followed by congratulations from all, and while
<a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"></a>these were being extended, Aunt Ella entered the room.
She advanced to meet Sir Stuart, who had been present at
Alice's reception. Quincy introduced Mdme. Archimbault,
and then Aunt Ella turned towards Linda. "This is the
young lady, I believe," said she, "who has just found a
long-lost relative, or rather, has been found by him. You
must be very happy, my dear, and it makes me very happy
to know that my nephew and niece, who are so dear to me,
have been instrumental in bringing this pleasure to you.
But have you been able to learn your mother's name?
Quincy did not mention that in his letter."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Quincy, stepping forward, "the letter contained
that information, but I thought I would rather tell
you about it than write it. My dear aunt, allow me to introduce
to you Miss Linda Fernborough Chessman."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Aunt Ella, starting back in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Aunt Ella;" and taking her hand in his
he drew her towards him. "Your husband had a brother,
Charles Chessman; he was an artist and lived in England;
while there he married; he wrote your husband some thirty
years ago that he was going to return to America, but
Uncle Robert, you told me, never heard from him again
after receiving the letter."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" assented Aunt Ella; "I have the letter. But
what is the mystery, Quincy? You know I can bear anything
but suspense."</p>

<p>"There is no mystery, auntie, now; it is all cleared up.
Uncle Robert's brother Charles married Linda Fernborough,
Sir Stuart's daughter. The vessel in which father,
mother, and child sailed for America was wrecked. Father
and mother were lost, but the child was rescued. This is
the child. Aunt Ella, Linda Chessman is your niece, but
unfortunately I am unable to call her cousin."</p>

<p>Aunt Ella embraced Linda and talked to her as a mother
might talk to her daughter. Her delight at finding this
relative of the husband whom she had loved so well and
<a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a>mourned so sincerely, showed itself in face, and voice, and
action. Her hospitality knew no bounds. Linda must
stay with her a month at least, so must Sir Stuart and
Mdme. Archimbault. It was the holiday season, and they
must all feast and be merry over this happy, unexpected
return.</p>

<p>It was a joyous party that gathered in the dining-room at
Aunt Ella's house that evening. She said that such an occasion
could not be fitly celebrated with plain cold water, so a
battle of choke old port was served to Sir Stuart, and
toasts to Mrs. Sawyer and Miss Chessman were drunk from
glasses filled with foaming champagne.</p>

<p>Then all adjourned to Aunt Ella's room and Uncle
Robert's prime cigars were offered to Sir Stuart and
Quincy. But Aunt Ella had too much to say to think of
her cigarette. For an hour conversation was general;
everybody took part in it. The events of the past year,
which were of so great interest to all present, were gone
over, and when conversation lagged it was because everybody
knew everything that everybody else knew.</p>

<p>Quincy spent that night at his father's house. The next
morning his mother told him that the author had selected
Christmas day on which to be received by them at dinner,
and that she was making unusual preparations for that
event.</p>

<p>"I wish I could invite a few friends to meet her that
day," said Quincy.</p>

<p>"You may invite as many as you choose, Quincy, if you
will promise to be here yourself. You have been away
from home so much the past year I hardly anticipate the
pleasure of your company on that day."</p>

<p>"Have no fear, mother," Quincy said. "I wish very
much to meet the author that father and you are so greatly
pleased with. Of course Aunt Ella is coming?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," answered his mother. "I understand that
the author has been stopping with her since the reception."</p><p><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495"></a></p>

<p>"I shall invite five friends," said Quincy, "and you may
depend upon me."</p>

<p>To his mother's surprise he gave her a slight embrace, a
light kiss upon her cheek, and was gone.</p>

<p>The sun showed its cheerful face on Christmas morning.
The snow that fell a fortnight previous had been washed
away by continued heavy rains. A cold wind, biting, but
healthful, quickened the pulse and brought roses to the
cheeks of holiday pedestrians.</p>

<p>The programme for the meals on Christmas day had
been arranged by Mrs. Sawyer as follows: Breakfast at
nine, dinner at one, and a light supper at six. It had always
been the rule in the Sawyer family to exchange Christmas
gifts at the breakfast hour. Quincy was present, and
his father, mother, and sisters thanked him for the valuable
presents that bore his card. Father, mother, and sisters,
on their part, had not forgotten Quincy, and the reunited
family had the most enjoyable time that they had experienced
for a year.</p>

<p>As Quincy rose to leave the table, he said to his mother,
"I have another gift for father and you, but it has not yet
arrived. I am going to see about it this morning."</p>

<p>"You will be sure to come to dinner, Quincy," fell from
his mother's lips.</p>

<p>"I promise you, mother," he replied. "I would not miss
it for anything."</p>

<p>A little after noontime, the Chessman carriage arrived
at the Beacon Street mansion of the Hon. Nathaniel
Adams Sawyer, and a moment later Mrs. Ella Chessman
and the young author, Bruce Douglas, were ushered into
the spacious and elegant parlor. They were received by
Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer and their daughter Florence.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later a carriage arrived before the same
mansion. Its occupants were Sir Stuart Fernborough, his
granddaughter, and Mdme. Archimbault. A few minutes
later Mr. and Mrs. Leopold Ernst appeared, having walked
<a name="Page_496" id="Page_496"></a>the short distance from their rooms on Chestnut Street.
The new arrivals were presented to Mr. and Mrs. Sawyer
by Mrs. Chessman, and a pleasant ante-prandial conversation
was soon under way.</p>

<p>From behind the curtains of a second-story window of
the mansion, a young miss had watched the arrival and departure
of the carriages. As the second one drove away
she exclaimed, "Oh! what a lark! Those last folks came in
Aunt Ella's carriage, too. I bet Quincy and auntie have
put up some sort of a game on pa and ma. I won't go
down stairs till Quincy comes, for I want to give my new
sister a hug and a squeeze and a kiss, and I sha'n't dare to
do it till Quincy has introduced her to pa and ma."</p>

<p>At that moment the young man, faultlessly attired, came
down stairs from the third story, and Maude sprang out
from her doorway on the second floor and said in a whisper,
"How long have you been home, Quincy?"</p>

<p>"I came in about half-past eleven," he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, you rogue," cried Maude. "I have been watching
out the window for an hour. I see it all now, you don't
mean to give pa and ma a chance to say boo until after
dinner. Let me go down first, Quincy."</p>

<p>Maude went down stairs and was duly presented to the
assembled guests as the youngest scion of the house of
Sawyer.</p>

<p>At exactly five minutes of one Quincy entered the parlor
through the rear door. Aunt Ella and Alice were seated
side by side between the two front windows. As Quincy
advanced he exchanged the compliments of the season with
the guests. Finally the Hon. Nathaniel and his son Quincy
stood facing Aunt Ella and Alice.</p>

<p>"Quincy," said his father, in slow, measured tones, "it
gives me great pleasure to present you to the, celebrated
young author, Bruce Douglas."</p>

<p>Quincy bent low, and Alice inclined her head in acknowledgment.
He reached forward, clasped her hand in his and
<a name="Page_497" id="Page_497"></a>took his place by her side. "Father, mother, and sisters,"
he cried, and there was a proud tone in his clear, ringing
voice, "there is still another presentation to be made&mdash;that
Christmas gift of which I spoke this morning at breakfast.
You see I hold this lady by the hand, which proves that
we are friends and not strangers. To her friends in the
town of Eastborough, where she was born, the daughter of
an honest farmer, who made a frugal living and no more,
she was known by the name of Mary Alice Pettengill. To
the story and book-reading public of the United States, she
is known as Bruce Douglas, but to me she is known by the
sacred name of wife. I present to you as a Christmas gift,
a daughter and a sister."</p>

<p>There was a moment of suspense, and all eyes were fixed
upon the parents so dramatically apprised of their son's
marriage. The Hon. Nathaniel cleared his throat, and advancing
slowly, took Alice's hand in his and said, "It gives
me great pleasure to welcome as a daughter one so highly
favored by nature with intellectual powers and such marked
endowments for a famous literary career. I am confident
that the reputation of our family will gain rather than lose
by such an alliance."</p>

<p>"He thinks her books are going to sell," remarked Leopold
to his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nathaniel Adams Sawyer took Alice's hand in hers
and kissed her upon the cheek. "You will always be welcome,
my daughter, at our home. I know we shall learn
to love you in time."</p>

<p>It was Florence's turn now. Like her mother, she took
her new sister's hand and gave her a society kiss on the
cheek. Then she spoke: "As mother said, I know I shall
learn to love you, sister, in time."</p>

<p>A slight form dashed through the front parlor door, and
throwing her arms about Alice's neck, gave her a hearty
kiss upon the lips. "My sweet sister, Alice, I love you now,
and I always shall love you, and I think my brother Quincy
<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a>is just the luckiest man in the world to get such a nice
wife."</p>

<p>Then abashed at her own vehemance, she got behind
Aunt Ella, who said to herself, "Maude has got some
heart."</p>

<p>Dinner was announced. The Hon. Nathaniel Adams
Sawyer offered his arm to Mrs. Quincy Adams Sawyer,
and they led the holiday procession. Sir Stuart Fernborough,
M.P., escorted Mrs. Sarah Quincy Sawyer; next
came Mr. Leopold Ernst and Miss Linda Fernborough
Chessman, followed by Mr. Quincy Adams Sawyer and
Mrs. Leopold Ernst; behind them walked, arm in arm, Mrs.
Ella Quincy Chessman and Mdme. Rose Archimbault;
while bringing up the rear came the Misses Florence Estelle
and Maude Gertrude Sawyer. Maude had politely
offered her arm to Florence, but the latter had firmly declined
to accept it. In this order they entered the gorgeous
dining-room and took their places at a table bearing
evidences of the greatest wealth, if not the greatest refinement,
to partake of their Christmas dinner.</p><p><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a></p>

<h3>FERNBOROUGH.<br /></h3>

<p>Five years passed away, years of not unmixed happiness
for any of those with whom this story has made
us acquainted. Quincy and Alice had undergone a severe
trial in the loss of two of the three little ones that had been
born to them; the remaining child was a fair little boy,
another Quincy, and upon him the bereaved parents lavished
all the wealth of their tenderness and affection.</p>

<p>In his political life, however, Quincy had found only
smooth and pleasant sailing, and thanks to his bright and
energetic nature, and not a little, perhaps, to his father's
name and influence, he had risen rapidly from place to place
and honor to honor. One of his earliest political moves
had been the introduction of a bill into the House for the
separation of Mason's Corner and Eastborough into individual
communities.</p>

<p>Soon after the incorporation of the former town under
its new name of Fernborough, Abbot Smith, at Quincy's
suggestion, had started the Fernborough Improvement
Association, and now after these few years, the result of its
labors was plainly and agreeably apparent. The ruins of
Uncle Ike's chicken coop had been removed, and grass
covered its former site. Shade trees had been planted along
all the principal streets, for the new town had streets instead
of roads. The three-mile road to Eastborough Centre
had been christened Mason Street, and the square before
Strout &amp; Maxwell's store had been named Mason
Square. Mrs. Hawkins's boarding house had become a
hotel, and was known as the Hawkins House. The square
<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500"></a>before the church was called Howe's Square, in honor of
the aged minister. The old Montrose road was now dignified
by the appellation of Montrose Avenue. The upper
road to Eastborough Centre that led by the old Putnam
house was named Pettengill Street, although Ezekiel protested
that it was a "mighty poor name for a street, even
if it did answer all right for a man." The great square
facing Montrose Avenue, upon which the Town Hall and
the Chessman Free Public Library had been built, was
called Putnam Square. On three sides of it, wide streets
had been laid out, on which many pretty houses had been
erected. These three streets had been named Quincy
Street, Adams Street, and Sawyer Street.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the fifteenth of June, a gala day in
the history of the town. The fifth anniversary of the laying
of the corner stone of the Town Hall and the library was
to be commemorated by a grand banquet given in the Town
Hall, and was to be graced by many distinguished guests,
among them the Hon. Quincy Adams Sawyer and wife,
and Mrs. Ella Chessman. After the banquet, which was to
take place in the evening, there was to be an open-air concert
given, followed by a grand display of fireworks. During
the feast, the citizens were to be admitted to the galleries,
so that they could see the guests and listen to the
speeches.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock the visiting party started off to view
the sights of the town. Under the leadership of the town
officers they turned their steps first towards the new library.
On entering this handsome building, they observed
hung over the balcony, facing them, a large oil painting of
a beautiful dark-haired, dark-eyed woman, dressed in satin
and velvet and ermine, and having a coronet upon her
head. Underneath was a tablet bearing an inscription.</p>

<p>"An admirable portrait," said Quincy to his wife. "Can
you read the tablet, dear? I fear I shall really have to see
Dr. Tillotson about my eyes."</p><p><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501"></a></p>

<p>Alice smiled at the allusion, and directing her gaze upon
it, read without the slightest hesitation: "Linda Putnam,
once a resident of this town, now Countess of Sussex, and
donor of this library building, which is named in honor of
her father, Charles Chessman, only brother of Robert
Chessman."</p>

<p>During the evening festivities the Town Hall was brilliantly
lighted, and every seat in the galleries and coigns of
vantage were occupied. The guests at the banquet numbered
fully sixty. A Boston caterer, with a corps of trained
waiters, had charge of the dinner. During its progress the
Cottonton Brass Band performed at intervals. They were
stationed in Putnam Square, and the music was not an
oppressive and disturbing element, as it often is at close
range on such occasions.</p>

<p>When coffee was served, Toastmaster Obadiah Strout,
Esq., arose, and the eyes of banqueters and sightseers were
turned toward him.</p>

<p>"This is a glorious day in the history of our town," the
toastmaster began, "The pleasant duty has fallen to me of
proposing the toasts to which we shall drink, and of introducing
our honored guests one by one. I know that words
of advice and encouragement will come from them. But
before I perform the duties that have been allotted to me,
it is my privilege to make a short address. Instead of doing
so, I shall tell you a little story, and it will be a different
kind of a story from what I have been in the habit of
telling."</p>

<p>This remark caused an audible titter to arise from some
of the auditors in the galleries, and Abner Stiles, who was
sitting behind Mrs. Hawkins, leaned over and said to her,
"I guess he's goin' to tell a true story."</p>

<p>The toastmaster continued: "More than six years ago a
young man from the city arrived in this town. It was
given out that he came down here for his health, but he
wasn't so sick but that he could begin to take an active part
<a name="Page_502" id="Page_502"></a>in town affairs as soon as he got here. They say confession
is good for the soul, and I'm goin' to confess that I didn't
take to this young man. I thought he was a city swell,
who had come down here to show off, and in company
with several friends, who looked at his visit down here
about the same as I did, we did all we could for a couple of
months to try and drive him out of town. Now I am
comin' to the point that I want to make. If we had let him
alone the chances are that he wouldn't have stayed here
more than a month any way. Now, s'posen he had gone
home at the end of the month; in that case he never would
have met the lady who sits by his side to-night, and who by
her marriage has added new lustre to her native town. If
he had not remained, she never would have written those
stories which are known the world over, and I tell you, fellow-citizens,
that in writing Blennerhassett, An American
Countess, The Majesty of the Law, and The Street Boy, she
has done more to make this town famous than all the men
who were ever born in it."</p>

<p>The speaker paused and drank a glass of water, while
cheers and applause came from all parts of the gallery.
Abner Stiles apparently forgot his surroundings, and,
thinking probably that it was a political rally, called out,
"Three cheers for Alice Pettengill"! which were given with
a will, much to his delight, and the surprise of the banqueters.</p>

<p>The toastmaster resumed: "If he had gone away disgusted
with the town and its people, he never would have
found out who Linda Putnam really was, and she, consequently,
would never have been what she is to-day, a peeress
of England and the great benefactress of this town, a
lady who will always have our deepest affection and most
sincere gratitude."</p>

<p>Again the orator paused, and the audience arose to its
feet. Applause, cheers, and the waving of handkerchiefs
attested that the speaker's words had voiced the popular
<a name="Page_503" id="Page_503"></a>feeling. Once more Abner Stiles's voice rose above the
din, and three cheers for "Lindy Putnam, Countess of Sussex,"
were given with such a will that the band outside
caught the enthusiasm and played "God Save the Queen,"
which most of the audience supposed was "America."</p>

<p>"In conclusion," said the orator, "I have one more point
to make, and that is a purely personal one. Some writer
has said the end justifies the means, and another writer puts
it this way, 'Do evil that good may come.' In these two
sayin's lies all the justification for many sayin's and doin's
that can be found; and if I were a conceited man or one inclined
to praise my own actions, I should say that the good
fortune of many of our distinguished guests this evening,
and the handsome financial backin' that this town has received,
are due principally to my personal exertions."</p>

<p>Here the speaker paused again and wiped his forehead,
which was bedewed with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Mrs. Hawkins to Olive Green, who
sat next to her, "to hear that man talk anybuddy would
think that nobuddy else in the town ever did anything."</p>

<p>"To conclude," said the speaker, "I don't wish, feller
citizens, to have you understand that I am defendin' my
actions. They were mean in spirit and mean in the way in
which they were done, but the one against whom they were
directed returned good for evil, and heaped coals of fire on
my head. At a time when events made me think he was
my greatest enemy, he became my greatest friend. It is to
his assistance, advice, and influence that I owe the present
honorable position that I hold in this town, and here to-night,
in his presence, and in the presence of you all, I
have made this confession to show that I am truly repentant
for the past. At the same time, I cannot help rejoicing in
the good fortune that those misdeeds were the means of securin'
for us all."</p>

<p>As the speaker sat down, overcome with emotion, he was
greeted with applause, which was redoubled when Mr. Sawyer
<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"></a>arose in his seat. But when Quincy leaned forward and
extended his hand to Strout, which the latter took, the excitement
rose to fever heat, and cheers for Quincy Adams
Sawyer and Obadiah Strout resounded throughout the hall
and fell upon the evening air. This time the band played
"The Star Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>Again the toastmaster arose and said, "Ladies and gentlemen,
the first toast that I am going to propose to-night is
a double one, because, for obvious reasons, it must include
not only the State, but its chief representative, who is with
us here to-night. Ladies and gentlemen, let us drink to the
Old Bay State, and may each loyal heart say within itself,
'God save the Commonwealth of Massachusetts!'" The
guests touched their lips to their glasses. "And now,"
continued the toastmaster, "to his Excellency <span class="smcap">Quincy
Adams Sawyer</span>, Governor of the Commonwealth, whom
I have the honor of introducing to you."</p>

<p>The Governor arose amid wild applause and loud acclamations,
while the band played "Hail to the Chief!"</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
